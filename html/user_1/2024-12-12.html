<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale generative models have shown impressive image-generation capabilities, propelled by massive data. However, this often inadvertently leads to the generation of harmful or inappropriate content and raises copyright concerns. Driven by these concerns, machine unlearning has become crucial to effectively purge undesirable knowledge from models. While existing literature has studied various unlearning techniques, these often suffer from either poor unlearning quality or degradation in text-image alignment after unlearning, due to the competitive nature of these objectives. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that seeks an optimal model update at each unlearning iteration, ensuring monotonic improvement on both objectives. We further derive the characterization of such an update. In addition, we design procedures to strategically diversify the unlearning and remaining datasets to boost performance improvement. Our evaluation demonstrates that our method effectively removes target classes from recent diffusion-based generative models and concepts from stable diffusion models while maintaining close alignment with the models' original trained states, thus outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Extraction of building footprint polygons from remotely sensed data is essential for several urban understanding tasks such as reconstruction, navigation, and mapping. Despite significant progress in the area, extracting accurate polygonal building footprints remains an open problem. In this paper, we introduce Pix2Poly, an attention-based end-to-end trainable and differentiable deep neural network capable of directly generating explicit high-quality building footprints in a ring graph format. Pix2Poly employs a generative encoder-decoder transformer to produce a sequence of graph vertex tokens whose connectivity information is learned by an optimal matching network. Compared to previous graph learning methods, ours is a truly end-to-end trainable approach that extracts high-quality building footprints and road networks without requiring complicated, computationally intensive raster loss functions and intricate training pipelines. Upon evaluating Pix2Poly on several complex and challenging datasets, we report that Pix2Poly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in several vector shape quality metrics while being an entirely explicit method.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We derive a general change of variables formula for score functions, showing that for a smooth, invertible transformation $\mathbf{y} = \phi(\mathbf{x})$, the transformed score function $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q(\mathbf{y})$ can be expressed directly in terms of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p(\mathbf{x})$. Using this result, we develop two applications: First, we establish a reverse-time Itô lemma for score-based diffusion models, allowing the use of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p_t(\mathbf{x})$ to reverse an SDE in the transformed space without directly learning $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q_t(\mathbf{y})$. This approach enables training diffusion models in one space but sampling in another, effectively decoupling the forward and reverse processes. Second, we introduce generalized sliced score matching, extending traditional sliced score matching from linear projections to arbitrary smooth transformations. This provides greater flexibility in high-dimensional density estimation. We demonstrate these theoretical advances through applications to diffusion on the probability simplex and empirically compare our generalized score matching approach against traditional sliced score matching methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal learning has recently gained significant popularity, demonstrating impressive performance across various zero-shot classification tasks and a range of perceptive and generative applications. Models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) are designed to bridge different modalities, such as images and text, by learning a shared representation space through contrastive learning. Despite their success, the working mechanisms underlying multimodal learning are not yet well understood. Notably, these models often exhibit a modality gap, where different modalities occupy distinct regions within the shared representation space. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the emergence of modality gap by characterizing the gradient flow learning dynamics. Specifically, we identify the critical roles of mismatched data pairs and a learnable temperature parameter in causing and perpetuating the modality gap during training. Furthermore, our theoretical insights are validated through experiments on practical CLIP models. These findings provide principled guidance for mitigating the modality gap, including strategies such as appropriate temperature scheduling and modality swapping. Additionally, we demonstrate that closing the modality gap leads to improved performance on tasks such as image-text retrieval.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models generate samples by incrementally reversing a process that turns data into noise. We show that when the step size goes to zero, the reversed process is invariant to the distribution of these increments. This reveals a previously unconsidered parameter in the design of diffusion models: the distribution of the diffusion step $\Delta x_k := x_{k} - x_{k + 1}$. This parameter is implicitly set by default to be normally distributed in most diffusion models. By lifting this assumption, we generalize the framework for designing diffusion models and establish an expanded class of diffusion processes with greater flexibility in the choice of loss function used during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these models on density estimation and generative modeling tasks on standard image datasets, and show that different choices of the distribution of $\Delta x_k$ result in qualitatively different generated samples.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We analyze the training of a two-layer autoencoder used to parameterize a flow-based generative model for sampling from a high-dimensional Gaussian mixture. Previous work shows that the phase where the relative probability between the modes is learned disappears as the dimension goes to infinity without an appropriate time schedule. We introduce a time dilation that solves this problem. This enables us to characterize the learned velocity field, finding a first phase where the probability of each mode is learned and a second phase where the variance of each mode is learned. We find that the autoencoder representing the velocity field learns to simplify by estimating only the parameters relevant to each phase. Turning to real data, we propose a method that, for a given feature, finds intervals of time where training improves accuracy the most on that feature. Since practitioners take a uniform distribution over training times, our method enables more efficient training. We provide preliminary experiments validating this approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a novel method for 3D scene editing using diffusion models, designed to ensure view consistency and realism across perspectives. Our approach leverages attention features extracted from a single reference image to define the intended edits. These features are warped across multiple views by aligning them with scene geometry derived from Gaussian splatting depth estimates. Injecting these warped features into other viewpoints enables coherent propagation of edits, achieving high fidelity and spatial alignment in 3D space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating versatile edits of 3D scenes, significantly advancing the capabilities of scene manipulation compared to the existing methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Physical adversarial attacks in driving scenarios can expose critical vulnerabilities in visual perception models. However, developing such attacks remains challenging due to diverse real-world backgrounds and the requirement for maintaining visual naturality. Building upon this challenge, we reformulate physical adversarial attacks as a one-shot patch-generation problem. Our approach generates adversarial patches through a deep generative model that considers the specific scene context, enabling direct physical deployment in matching environments. The primary challenge lies in simultaneously achieving two objectives: generating adversarial patches that effectively mislead object detection systems while determining contextually appropriate placement within the scene. We propose MAGIC (Mastering Physical Adversarial Generation In Context), a novel framework powered by multi-modal LLM agents to address these challenges. MAGIC automatically understands scene context and orchestrates adversarial patch generation through the synergistic interaction of language and vision capabilities. MAGIC orchestrates three specialized LLM agents: The adv-patch generation agent (GAgent) masters the creation of deceptive patches through strategic prompt engineering for text-to-image models. The adv-patch deployment agent (DAgent) ensures contextual coherence by determining optimal placement strategies based on scene understanding. The self-examination agent (EAgent) completes this trilogy by providing critical oversight and iterative refinement of both processes. We validate our method on both digital and physical level, \ie, nuImage and manually captured real scenes, where both statistical and visual results prove that our MAGIC is powerful and effectively for attacking wide-used object detection systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning has the potential of lifting several of the key challenges in reinforcement learning today, such as exploration, representation learning, and reward design. Recent work (METRA) has effectively argued that moving away from mutual information and instead optimizing a certain Wasserstein distance is important for good performance. In this paper, we argue that the benefits seen in that paper can largely be explained within the existing framework of mutual information skill learning (MISL). Our analysis suggests a new MISL method (contrastive successor features) that retains the excellent performance of METRA with fewer moving parts, and highlights connections between skill learning, contrastive representation learning, and successor features. Finally, through careful ablation studies, we provide further insight into some of the key ingredients for both our method and METRA.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Physical adversarial examples (PAEs) are regarded as "whistle-blowers" of real-world risks in deep-learning applications. However, current PAE generation studies show limited adaptive attacking ability to diverse and varying scenes. The key challenges in generating dynamic PAEs are exploring their patterns under noisy gradient feedback and adapting the attack to agnostic scenario natures. To address the problems, we present DynamicPAE, the first generative framework that enables scene-aware real-time physical attacks beyond static attacks. Specifically, to train the dynamic PAE generator under noisy gradient feedback, we introduce the residual-driven sample trajectory guidance technique, which redefines the training task to break the limited feedback information restriction that leads to the degeneracy problem. Intuitively, it allows the gradient feedback to be passed to the generator through a low-noise auxiliary task, thereby guiding the optimization away from degenerate solutions and facilitating a more comprehensive and stable exploration of feasible PAEs. To adapt the generator to agnostic scenario natures, we introduce the context-aligned scene expectation simulation process, consisting of the conditional-uncertainty-aligned data module and the skewness-aligned objective re-weighting module. The former enhances robustness in the context of incomplete observation by employing a conditional probabilistic model for domain randomization, while the latter facilitates consistent stealth control across different attack targets by automatically reweighting losses based on the skewness indicator. Extensive digital and physical evaluations demonstrate the superior attack performance of DynamicPAE, attaining a 1.95 $\times$ boost (65.55% average AP drop under attack) on representative object detectors (e.g., Yolo-v8) over state-of-the-art static PAE generating methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized intelligent services by enabling logical reasoning, tool use, and interaction with external systems as agents. The advancement of LLMs is frequently hindered by the scarcity of high-quality data, much of which is inherently sensitive. Federated learning (FL) offers a potential solution by facilitating the collaborative training of distributed LLMs while safeguarding private data. However, FL frameworks face significant bandwidth and computational demands, along with challenges from heterogeneous data distributions. The emerging in-context learning capability of LLMs offers a promising approach by aggregating natural language rather than bulky model parameters. Yet, this method risks privacy leakage, as it necessitates the collection and presentation of data samples from various clients during aggregation. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving Federated In-Context LLM Agent Learning (FICAL) algorithm, which to our best knowledge for the first work unleashes the power of in-context learning to train diverse LLM agents through FL. In our design, knowledge compendiums generated by a novel LLM-enhanced Knowledge Compendiums Generation (KCG) module are transmitted between clients and the server instead of model parameters in previous FL methods. Apart from that, an incredible Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Tool Learning and Utilizing (TLU) module is designed and we incorporate the aggregated global knowledge compendium as a teacher to teach LLM agents the usage of tools. We conducted extensive experiments and the results show that FICAL has competitive performance compared to other SOTA baselines with a significant communication cost decrease of $\mathbf{3.33\times10^5}$ times.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Statistical downscaling is a technique used in climate modeling to increase the resolution of climate simulations. High-resolution climate information is essential for various high-impact applications, including natural hazard risk assessment. However, simulating climate at high resolution is intractable. Thus, climate simulations are often conducted at a coarse scale and then downscaled to the desired resolution. Existing downscaling techniques are either simulation-based methods with high computational costs, or statistical approaches with limitations in accuracy or application specificity. We introduce Generative Bias Correction and Super-Resolution (GenBCSR), a two-stage probabilistic framework for statistical downscaling that overcomes the limitations of previous methods. GenBCSR employs two transformations to match high-dimensional distributions at different resolutions: (i) the first stage, bias correction, aligns the distributions at coarse scale, (ii) the second stage, statistical super-resolution, lifts the corrected coarse distribution by introducing fine-grained details. Each stage is instantiated by a state-of-the-art generative model, resulting in an efficient and effective computational pipeline for the well-studied distribution matching problem. By framing the downscaling problem as distribution matching, GenBCSR relaxes the constraints of supervised learning, which requires samples to be aligned. Despite not requiring such correspondence, we show that GenBCSR surpasses standard approaches in predictive accuracy of critical impact variables, particularly in predicting the tails (99% percentile) of composite indexes composed of interacting variables, achieving up to 4-5 folds of error reduction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The unwavering disparity in labeled resources between resource-rich languages and those considered low-resource remains a significant impediment for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent strides in cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL), mainly through semantically aligned examples retrieved from multilingual pre-trained transformers, have shown promise in mitigating this issue. However, our investigation reveals that LLMs intrinsically reward in-language semantically aligned cross-lingual instances over direct cross-lingual semantic alignments, with a pronounced disparity in handling time-sensitive queries in the X-ICL setup. Such queries demand sound temporal reasoning ability from LLMs, yet the advancements have predominantly focused on English. This study aims to bridge this gap by improving temporal reasoning capabilities in low-resource languages. To this end, we introduce mTEMPREASON a temporal reasoning dataset aimed at the varied degrees of low-resource languages and propose Cross-Lingual Time-Sensitive Semantic Alignment (CLiTSSA), a novel method to improve temporal reasoning in these contexts. To facilitate this, we construct an extension of mTEMPREASON comprising pairs of parallel cross-language temporal queries along with their anticipated in-language semantic similarity scores. Our empirical evidence underscores the superior performance of CLiTSSA compared to established baselines across three languages - Romanian, German, and French, encompassing three temporal tasks and including a diverse set of four contemporaneous LLMs. This marks a significant step forward in addressing resource disparity in the context of temporal reasoning across languages.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The model-based estimation of 3D animal pose and shape from images enables computational modeling of animal behavior. Training models for this purpose requires large amounts of labeled image data with precise pose and shape annotations. However, capturing such data requires the use of multi-view or marker-based motion-capture systems, which are impractical to adapt to wild animals in situ and impossible to scale across a comprehensive set of animal species. Some have attempted to address the challenge of procuring training data by pseudo-labeling individual real-world images through manual 2D annotation, followed by 3D-parameter optimization to those labels. While this approach may produce silhouette-aligned samples, the obtained pose and shape parameters are often implausible due to the ill-posed nature of the monocular fitting problem. Sidestepping real-world ambiguity, others have designed complex synthetic-data-generation pipelines leveraging video-game engines and collections of artist-designed 3D assets. Such engines yield perfect ground-truth annotations but are often lacking in visual realism and require considerable manual effort to adapt to new species or environments. Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose an alternative approach to synthetic-data generation: rendering with a conditional image-generation model. We introduce a pipeline that samples a diverse set of poses and shapes for a variety of mammalian quadrupeds and generates realistic images with corresponding ground-truth pose and shape parameters. To demonstrate the scalability of our approach, we introduce GenZoo, a synthetic dataset containing one million images of distinct subjects. We train a 3D pose and shape regressor on GenZoo, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on a real-world animal pose and shape estimation benchmark, despite being trained solely on synthetic data. this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-language models (VLMs), serve as foundation models for multi-modal applications such as image captioning and text-to-image generation. Recent studies have highlighted limitations in VLM text encoders, particularly in areas like compositionality and semantic understanding, though the underlying reasons for these limitations remain unclear. In this work, we aim to address this gap by analyzing the syntactic information, one of the fundamental linguistic properties, encoded by the text encoders of VLMs. We perform a thorough analysis comparing VLMs with different objective functions, parameter size and training data size, and with uni-modal language models (ULMs) in their ability to encode syntactic knowledge. Our findings suggest that ULM text encoders acquire syntactic information more effectively than those in VLMs. The syntactic information learned by VLM text encoders is shaped primarily by the pre-training objective, which plays a more crucial role than other factors such as model architecture, model size, or the volume of pre-training data. Models exhibit different layer-wise trends where CLIP performance dropped across layers while for other models, middle layers are rich in encoding syntactic knowledge.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Oil spills in the ocean pose severe environmental risks, making early detection essential. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) based oil spill segmentation offers robust monitoring under various conditions but faces challenges due to the limited labeled data and inherent speckle noise in SAR imagery. To address these issues, we propose (i) a diffusion-based Data Augmentation and Knowledge Distillation (DAKD) pipeline and (ii) a novel SAR oil spill segmentation network, called SAROSS-Net. In our DAKD pipeline, we present a diffusion-based SAR-JointNet that learns to generate realistic SAR images and their labels for segmentation, by effectively modeling joint distribution with balancing two modalities. The DAKD pipeline augments the training dataset and distills knowledge from SAR-JointNet by utilizing generated soft labels (pixel-wise probability maps) to supervise our SAROSS-Net. The SAROSS-Net is designed to selectively transfer high-frequency features from noisy SAR images, by employing novel Context-Aware Feature Transfer blocks along skip connections. We demonstrate our SAR-JointNet can generate realistic SAR images and well-aligned segmentation labels, providing the augmented data to train SAROSS-Net with enhanced generalizability. Our SAROSS-Net trained with the DAKD pipeline significantly outperforms existing SAR oil spill segmentation methods with large margins.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been widely used as an effective self-supervised learning method for graph representation learning. However, how to apply adequate and stable graph augmentation to generating proper views for contrastive learning remains an essential problem. Dropping edges is a primary augmentation in GCL while adding edges is not a common method due to its unstable performance. To our best knowledge, there is no theoretical analysis to study why dropping edges usually outperforms adding edges. To answer this question, we introduce a new metric, namely Error Passing Rate (EPR), to quantify how a graph fits the network. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions, we propose a novel GCL algorithm, Error-PAssing-based Graph Contrastive Learning (EPAGCL), which uses both edge adding and edge dropping as its augmentation. To be specific, we generate views by adding and dropping edges according to the weights derived from EPR. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets are conducted to validate the correctness of our theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Raman spectroscopy has attracted significant attention in various biochemical detection fields, especially in the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria. The integration of this technology with deep learning to facilitate automated bacterial Raman spectroscopy diagnosis has emerged as a key focus in recent research. However, the diagnostic performance of existing deep learning methods largely depends on a sufficient dataset, and in scenarios where there is a limited availability of Raman spectroscopy data, it is inadequate to fully optimize the numerous parameters of deep neural networks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a data generation method utilizing deep generative models to expand the data volume and enhance the recognition accuracy of bacterial Raman spectra. Specifically, we introduce DiffRaman, a conditional latent denoising diffusion probability model for Raman spectra generation. Experimental results demonstrate that synthetic bacterial Raman spectra generated by DiffRaman can effectively emulate real experimental spectra, thereby enhancing the performance of diagnostic models, especially under conditions of limited data. Furthermore, compared to existing generative models, the proposed DiffRaman offers improvements in both generation quality and computational efficiency. Our DiffRaman approach offers a well-suited solution for automated bacteria Raman spectroscopy diagnosis in data-scarce scenarios, offering new insights into alleviating the labor of spectroscopic measurements and enhancing rare bacteria identification.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Image inpainting is an important image generation task, which aims to restore corrupted image from partial visible area. Recently, diffusion Schrödinger bridge methods effectively tackle this task by modeling the translation between corrupted and target images as a diffusion Schrödinger bridge process along a noising schedule path. Although these methods have shown superior performance, in this paper, we find that 1) existing methods suffer from a schedule-restoration mismatching issue, i.e., the theoretical schedule and practical restoration processes usually exist a large discrepancy, which theoretically results in the schedule not fully leveraged for restoring images; and 2) the key reason causing such issue is that the restoration process of all pixels are actually asynchronous but existing methods set a synchronous noise schedule to them, i.e., all pixels shares the same noise schedule. To this end, we propose a schedule-Asynchronous Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge (AsyncDSB) for image inpainting. Our insight is preferentially scheduling pixels with high frequency (i.e., large gradients) and then low frequency (i.e., small gradients). Based on this insight, given a corrupted image, we first train a network to predict its gradient map in corrupted area. Then, we regard the predicted image gradient as prior and design a simple yet effective pixel-asynchronous noise schedule strategy to enhance the diffusion Schrödinger bridge. Thanks to the asynchronous schedule at pixels, the temporal interdependence of restoration process between pixels can be fully characterized for high-quality image inpainting. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our AsyncDSB achieves superior performance, especially on FID with around 3% - 14% improvement over state-of-the-art baseline methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the remarkable generative potential of diffusion-based models, numerous researches have investigated jailbreak attacks targeting these frameworks. A particularly concerning threat within image models is the generation of Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content. Despite the implementation of security filters, numerous efforts continue to explore ways to circumvent these safeguards. Current attack methodologies primarily encompass adversarial prompt engineering or concept obfuscation, yet they frequently suffer from slow search efficiency, conspicuous attack characteristics and poor alignment with targets. To overcome these challenges, we propose Antelope, a more robust and covert jailbreak attack strategy designed to expose security vulnerabilities inherent in generative models. Specifically, Antelope leverages the confusion of sensitive concepts with similar ones, facilitates searches in the semantically adjacent space of these related concepts and aligns them with the target imagery, thereby generating sensitive images that are consistent with the target and capable of evading detection. Besides, we successfully exploit the transferability of model-based attacks to penetrate online black-box services. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Antelope outperforms existing baselines across multiple defensive mechanisms, underscoring its efficacy and versatility.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dynamic graphs exhibit intertwined spatio-temporal evolutionary patterns, widely existing in the real world. Nevertheless, the structure incompleteness, noise, and redundancy result in poor robustness for Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs). Dynamic Graph Structure Learning (DGSL) offers a promising way to optimize graph structures. However, aside from encountering unacceptable quadratic complexity, it overly relies on heuristic priors, making it hard to discover underlying predictive patterns. How to efficiently refine the dynamic structures, capture intrinsic dependencies, and learn robust representations, remains under-explored. In this work, we propose the novel DG-Mamba, a robust and efficient Dynamic Graph structure learning framework with the Selective State Space Models (Mamba). To accelerate the spatio-temporal structure learning, we propose a kernelized dynamic message-passing operator that reduces the quadratic time complexity to linear. To capture global intrinsic dynamics, we establish the dynamic graph as a self-contained system with State Space Model. By discretizing the system states with the cross-snapshot graph adjacency, we enable the long-distance dependencies capturing with the selective snapshot scan. To endow learned dynamic structures more expressive with informativeness, we propose the self-supervised Principle of Relevant Information for DGSL to regularize the most relevant yet least redundant information, enhancing global robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the robustness and efficiency of our DG-Mamba compared with the state-of-the-art baselines against adversarial attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models aim to produce synthetic data indistinguishable from real distributions, but iterative training on self-generated data can lead to \emph{model collapse (MC)}, where performance degrades over time. In this work, we provide the first theoretical analysis of MC in Rectified Flow by framing it within the context of Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs). We show that when DAE models are trained on recursively generated synthetic data with small noise variance, they suffer from MC with progressive diminishing generation quality. To address this MC issue, we propose methods that strategically incorporate real data into the training process, even when direct noise-image pairs are unavailable. Our proposed techniques, including Reverse Collapse-Avoiding (RCA) Reflow and Online Collapse-Avoiding Reflow (OCAR), effectively prevent MC while maintaining the efficiency benefits of Rectified Flow. Extensive experiments on standard image datasets demonstrate that our methods not only mitigate MC but also improve sampling efficiency, leading to higher-quality image generation with fewer sampling steps.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the scarcity and unpredictable nature of defect samples, industrial anomaly detection (IAD) predominantly employs unsupervised learning. However, all unsupervised IAD methods face a common challenge: the inherent bias in normal samples, which causes models to focus on variable regions while overlooking potential defects in invariant areas. To effectively overcome this, it is essential to decompose and recalibrate attention, guiding the model to suppress irrelevant variations and concentrate on subtle, defect-susceptible areas. In this paper, we propose Recalibrating Attention of Industrial Anomaly Detection (RAAD), a framework that systematically decomposes and recalibrates attention maps. RAAD employs a two-stage process: first, it reduces attention bias through quantization, and second, it fine-tunes defect-prone regions for improved sensitivity. Central to this framework is Hierarchical Quantization Scoring (HQS), which dynamically allocates bit-widths across layers based on their anomaly detection contributions. HQS dynamically adjusts bit-widths based on the hierarchical nature of attention maps, compressing lower layers that produce coarse and noisy attention while preserving deeper layers with sharper, defect-focused attention. This approach optimizes both computational efficiency and the model' s sensitivity to anomalies. We validate the effectiveness of RAAD on 32 datasets using a single 3090ti. Experiments demonstrate that RAAD, balances the complexity and expressive power of the model, enhancing its anomaly detection capability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Prevalent lossy image compression schemes can be divided into: 1) explicit image compression (EIC), including traditional standards and neural end-to-end algorithms; 2) implicit image compression (IIC) based on implicit neural representations (INR). The former is encountering impasses of either leveling off bitrate reduction at a cost of tremendous complexity while the latter suffers from excessive smoothing quality as well as lengthy decoder models. In this paper, we propose an innovative paradigm, which we dub \textbf{Unicorn} (\textbf{U}nified \textbf{N}eural \textbf{I}mage \textbf{C}ompression with \textbf{O}ne \textbf{N}number \textbf{R}econstruction). By conceptualizing the images as index-image pairs and learning the inherent distribution of pairs in a subtle neural network model, Unicorn can reconstruct a visually pleasing image from a randomly generated noise with only one index number. The neural model serves as the unified decoder of images while the noises and indexes corresponds to explicit representations. As a proof of concept, we propose an effective and efficient prototype of Unicorn based on latent diffusion models with tailored model designs. Quantitive and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our prototype achieves significant bitrates reduction compared with EIC and IIC algorithms. More impressively, benefitting from the unified decoder, our compression ratio escalates as the quantity of images increases. We envision that more advanced model designs will endow Unicorn with greater potential in image compression. We will release our codes in \url{this https URL}.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper presents the Long Context and Form Output (LCFO) benchmark, a novel evaluation framework for assessing gradual summarization and summary expansion capabilities across diverse domains. LCFO consists of long input documents (5k words average length), each of which comes with three summaries of different lengths (20%, 10%, and 5% of the input text), as well as approximately 15 questions and answers (QA) related to the input content. Notably, LCFO also provides alignments between specific QA pairs and corresponding summaries in 7 domains. The primary motivation behind providing summaries of different lengths is to establish a controllable framework for generating long texts from shorter inputs, i.e. summary expansion. To establish an evaluation metric framework for summarization and summary expansion, we provide human evaluation scores for human-generated outputs, as well as results from various state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). GPT-4o-mini achieves best human scores among automatic systems in both summarization and summary expansion tasks (~ +10% and +20%, respectively). It even surpasses human output quality in the case of short summaries (~ +7%). Overall automatic metrics achieve low correlations with human evaluation scores (~ 0.4) but moderate correlation on specific evaluation aspects such as fluency and attribution (~ 0.6). The LCFO benchmark offers a standardized platform for evaluating summarization and summary expansion performance, as well as corresponding automatic metrics, thereby providing an important evaluation framework to advance generative AI.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Automatic detection of prominence at the word and syllable-levels is critical for building computer-assisted language learning systems. It has been shown that prosody embeddings learned by the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-speech (TTS) systems could generate word- and syllable-level prominence in the synthesized speech as natural as in native speech. To understand the effectiveness of prosody embeddings from TTS for prominence detection under nonnative context, a comparative analysis is conducted on the embeddings extracted from native and non-native speech considering the prominence-related embeddings: duration, energy, and pitch from a SOTA TTS named FastSpeech2. These embeddings are extracted under two conditions considering: 1) only text, 2) both speech and text. For the first condition, the embeddings are extracted directly from the TTS inference mode, whereas for the second condition, we propose to extract from the TTS under training mode. Experiments are conducted on native speech corpus: Tatoeba, and non-native speech corpus: ISLE. For experimentation, word-level prominence locations are manually annotated for both corpora. The highest relative improvement on word \& syllable-level prominence detection accuracies with the TTS embeddings are found to be 13.7% & 5.9% and 16.2% & 6.9% compared to those with the heuristic-based features and self-supervised Wav2Vec-2.0 representations, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To address catastrophic forgetting in Continual Relation Extraction (CRE), many current approaches rely on memory buffers to rehearse previously learned knowledge while acquiring new tasks. Recently, prompt-based methods have emerged as potent alternatives to rehearsal-based strategies, demonstrating strong empirical performance. However, upon analyzing existing prompt-based approaches for CRE, we identified several critical limitations, such as inaccurate prompt selection, inadequate mechanisms for mitigating forgetting in shared parameters, and suboptimal handling of cross-task and within-task variances. To overcome these challenges, we draw inspiration from the relationship between prefix-tuning and mixture of experts, proposing a novel approach that employs a prompt pool for each task, capturing variations within each task while enhancing cross-task variances. Furthermore, we incorporate a generative model to consolidate prior knowledge within shared parameters, eliminating the need for explicit data storage. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art prompt-based and rehearsal-free methods in continual relation extraction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In diffusion models, samples are generated through an iterative refinement process, requiring hundreds of sequential model evaluations. Several recent methods have introduced approximations (fewer discretization steps or distillation) to trade off speed at the cost of sample quality. In contrast, we introduce Self-Refining Diffusion Samplers (SRDS) that retain sample quality and can improve latency at the cost of additional parallel compute. We take inspiration from the Parareal algorithm, a popular numerical method for parallel-in-time integration of differential equations. In SRDS, a quick but rough estimate of a sample is first created and then iteratively refined in parallel through Parareal iterations. SRDS is not only guaranteed to accurately solve the ODE and converge to the serial solution but also benefits from parallelization across the diffusion trajectory, enabling batched inference and pipelining. As we demonstrate for pre-trained diffusion models, the early convergence of this refinement procedure drastically reduces the number of steps required to produce a sample, speeding up generation for instance by up to 1.7x on a 25-step StableDiffusion-v2 benchmark and up to 4.3x on longer trajectories.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the proliferation of the Internet and smart devices, IoT technology has seen significant advancements and has become an integral component of smart homes, urban security, smart logistics, and other sectors. IoT facilitates real-time monitoring of critical production indicators, enabling businesses to detect potential quality issues, anticipate equipment malfunctions, and refine processes, thereby minimizing losses and reducing costs. Furthermore, IoT enhances real-time asset tracking, optimizing asset utilization and management. However, the expansion of IoT has also led to a rise in cybercrimes, with devices increasingly serving as vectors for malicious attacks. As the number of IoT devices grows, there is an urgent need for robust network security measures to counter these escalating threats. This paper introduces a deep learning model incorporating LSTM and attention mechanisms, a pivotal strategy in combating cybercrime in IoT networks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets including IoT-23, BoT-IoT, IoT network intrusion, MQTT, and MQTTset, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The common occurrence of occlusion-induced incompleteness in point clouds has made point cloud completion (PCC) a highly-concerned task in the field of geometric processing. Existing PCC methods typically produce complete point clouds from partial point clouds in a coarse-to-fine paradigm, with the coarse stage generating entire shapes and the fine stage improving texture details. Though diffusion models have demonstrated effectiveness in the coarse stage, the fine stage still faces challenges in producing high-fidelity results due to the ill-posed nature of PCC. The intrinsic contextual information for texture details in partial point clouds is the key to solving the challenge. In this paper, we propose a high-fidelity PCC method that digs into both short and long-range contextual information from the partial point cloud in the fine stage. Specifically, after generating the coarse point cloud via a diffusion-based coarse generator, a mixed sampling module introduces short-range contextual information from partial point clouds into the fine stage. A surface freezing modules safeguards points from noise-free partial point clouds against disruption. As for the long-range contextual information, we design a similarity modeling module to derive similarity with rigid transformation invariance between points, conducting effective matching of geometric manifold features globally. In this way, the high-quality components present in the partial point cloud serve as valuable references for refining the coarse point cloud with high fidelity. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method over SOTA competitors. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) has become a promising paradigm for adapting large-scale vision foundation models to downstream tasks. Typical methods primarily leverage the intrinsic low rank property to make decomposition, learning task-specific weights while compressing parameter size. However, such approaches predominantly manipulate within the original feature space utilizing a single-branch structure, which might be suboptimal for decoupling the learned representations and patterns. In this paper, we propose ALoRE, a novel PETL method that reuses the hypercomplex parameterized space constructed by Kronecker product to Aggregate Low Rank Experts using a multi-branch paradigm, disentangling the learned cognitive patterns during training. Thanks to the artful design, ALoRE maintains negligible extra parameters and can be effortlessly merged into the frozen backbone via re-parameterization in a sequential manner, avoiding additional inference latency. We conduct extensive experiments on 24 image classification tasks using various backbone variants. Experimental results demonstrate that ALoRE outperforms the full fine-tuning strategy and other state-of-the-art PETL methods in terms of performance and parameter efficiency. For instance, ALoRE obtains 3.06% and 9.97% Top-1 accuracy improvement on average compared to full fine-tuning on the FGVC datasets and VTAB-1k benchmark by only updating 0.15M parameters.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video summarization aims to eliminate visual redundancy while retaining key parts of video to construct concise and comprehensive synopses. Most existing methods use discriminative models to predict the importance scores of video frames. However, these methods are susceptible to annotation inconsistency caused by the inherent subjectivity of different annotators when annotating the same video. In this paper, we introduce a generative framework for video summarization that learns how to generate summaries from a probability distribution perspective, effectively reducing the interference of subjective annotation noise. Specifically, we propose a novel diffusion summarization method based on the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), which learns the probability distribution of training data through noise prediction, and generates summaries by iterative denoising. Our method is more resistant to subjective annotation noise, and is less prone to overfitting the training data than discriminative methods, with strong generalization ability. Moreover, to facilitate training DDPM with limited data, we employ an unsupervised video summarization model to implement the earlier denoising process. Extensive experiments on various datasets (TVSum, SumMe, and FPVSum) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in legal judgment prediction (LJP) has the potential to transform the legal landscape, particularly in jurisdictions like India, where a significant backlog of cases burdens the legal system. This paper introduces NyayaAnumana, the largest and most diverse corpus of Indian legal cases compiled for LJP, encompassing a total of 7,02,945 preprocessed cases. NyayaAnumana, which combines the words "Nyay" (judgment) and "Anuman" (prediction or inference) respectively for most major Indian languages, includes a wide range of cases from the Supreme Court, High Courts, Tribunal Courts, District Courts, and Daily Orders and, thus, provides unparalleled diversity and coverage. Our dataset surpasses existing datasets like PredEx and ILDC, offering a comprehensive foundation for advanced AI research in the legal domain. In addition to the dataset, we present INLegalLlama, a domain-specific generative large language model (LLM) tailored to the intricacies of the Indian legal system. It is developed through a two-phase training approach over a base LLaMa model. First, Indian legal documents are injected using continual pretraining. Second, task-specific supervised finetuning is done. This method allows the model to achieve a deeper understanding of legal contexts. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating diverse court data significantly boosts model accuracy, achieving approximately 90% F1-score in prediction tasks. INLegalLlama not only improves prediction accuracy but also offers comprehensible explanations, addressing the need for explainability in AI-assisted legal decisions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial samples crafted by adding imperceptible perturbations to clean data, potentially leading to incorrect and dangerous predictions. Adversarial purification has been an effective means to improve DNNs robustness by removing these perturbations before feeding the data into the model. However, it faces significant challenges in preserving key structural and semantic information of data, as the imperceptible nature of adversarial perturbations makes it hard to avoid over-correcting, which can destroy important information and degrade model performance. In this paper, we break away from traditional adversarial purification methods by focusing on the clean data manifold. To this end, we reveal that samples generated by a well-trained generative model are close to clean ones but far from adversarial ones. Leveraging this insight, we propose Consistency Model-based Adversarial Purification (CMAP), which optimizes vectors within the latent space of a pre-trained consistency model to generate samples for restoring clean data. Specifically, 1) we propose a \textit{Perceptual consistency restoration} mechanism by minimizing the discrepancy between generated samples and input samples in both pixel and perceptual spaces. 2) To maintain the optimized latent vectors within the valid data manifold, we introduce a \textit{Latent distribution consistency constraint} strategy to align generated samples with the clean data distribution. 3) We also apply a \textit{Latent vector consistency prediction} scheme via an ensemble approach to enhance prediction reliability. CMAP fundamentally addresses adversarial perturbations at their source, providing a robust purification. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 show that our CMAP significantly enhances robustness against strong adversarial attacks while preserving high natural accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Inferring 3D structures from sparse, unposed observations is challenging due to its unconstrained nature. Recent methods propose to predict implicit representations directly from unposed inputs in a data-driven manner, achieving promising results. However, these methods do not utilize geometric priors and cannot hallucinate the appearance of unseen regions, thus making it challenging to reconstruct fine geometric and textural details. To tackle this challenge, our key idea is to reformulate this ill-posed problem as conditional novel view synthesis, aiming to generate complete observations from limited input views to facilitate reconstruction. With complete observations, the poses of the input views can be easily recovered and further used to optimize the reconstructed object. To this end, we propose a novel pipeline Pragmatist. First, we generate a complete observation of the object via a multiview conditional diffusion model. Then, we use a feed-forward large reconstruction model to obtain the reconstructed mesh. To further improve the reconstruction quality, we recover the poses of input views by inverting the obtained 3D representations and further optimize the texture using detailed input views. Unlike previous approaches, our pipeline improves reconstruction by efficiently leveraging unposed inputs and generative priors, circumventing the direct resolution of highly ill-posed problems. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves promising performance in several benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep-learning based traffic prediction models require vast amounts of data to learn embedded spatial and temporal dependencies. The inherent privacy and commercial sensitivity of such data has encouraged a shift towards decentralised data-driven methods, such as Federated Learning (FL). Under a traditional Machine Learning paradigm, traffic flow prediction models can capture spatial and temporal relationships within centralised data. In reality, traffic data is likely distributed across separate data silos owned by multiple stakeholders. In this work, a cross-silo FL setting is motivated to facilitate stakeholder collaboration for optimal traffic flow prediction applications. This work introduces an FL framework, referred to as FedTPS, to generate synthetic data to augment each client's local dataset by training a diffusion-based trajectory generation model through FL. The proposed framework is evaluated on a large-scale real world ride-sharing dataset using various FL methods and Traffic Flow Prediction models, including a novel prediction model we introduce, which leverages Temporal and Graph Attention mechanisms to learn the Spatio-Temporal dependencies embedded within regional traffic flow data. Experimental results show that FedTPS outperforms multiple other FL baselines with respect to global model performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurately depicting real-world landscapes in remote sensing (RS) images requires precise alignment between objects and their environment. However, most existing synthesis methods for natural images prioritize foreground control, often reducing the background to plain textures. This neglects the interaction between foreground and background, which can lead to incoherence in RS scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CC-Diff, a Diffusion Model-based approach for RS image generation with enhanced Context Coherence. To capture spatial interdependence, we propose a sequential pipeline where background generation is conditioned on synthesized foreground instances. Distinct learnable queries are also employed to model both the complex background texture and its semantic relation to the foreground. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CC-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and positional precision, excelling in both RS and natural image domains. CC-Diff also shows strong trainability, improving detection accuracy by 2.04 mAP on DOTA and 2.25 mAP on the COCO benchmark.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As one of the most successful generative models, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in synthesizing high-quality images. These models learn the underlying high-dimensional data distribution in an unsupervised manner. Despite their success, diffusion models are highly data-driven and prone to inheriting the imbalances and biases present in real-world data. Some studies have attempted to address these issues by designing text prompts for known biases or using bias labels to construct unbiased data. While these methods have shown improved results, real-world scenarios often contain various unknown biases, and obtaining bias labels is particularly challenging. In this paper, we emphasize the necessity of mitigating bias in pre-trained diffusion models without relying on auxiliary bias annotations. To tackle this problem, we propose a framework, InvDiff, which aims to learn invariant semantic information for diffusion guidance. Specifically, we propose identifying underlying biases in the training data and designing a novel debiasing training objective. Then, we employ a lightweight trainable module that automatically preserves invariant semantic information and uses it to guide the diffusion model's sampling process toward unbiased outcomes simultaneously. Notably, we only need to learn a small number of parameters in the lightweight learnable module without altering the pre-trained diffusion model. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that the implementation of InvDiff is equivalent to reducing the error upper bound of generalization. Extensive experimental results on three publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that InvDiff effectively reduces biases while maintaining the quality of image generation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Controllable person image generation aims to generate a person image conditioned on reference images, allowing precise control over the person's appearance or pose. However, prior methods often distort fine-grained textural details from the reference image, despite achieving high overall image quality. We attribute these distortions to inadequate attention to corresponding regions in the reference image. To address this, we thereby propose learning flow fields in attention (Leffa), which explicitly guides the target query to attend to the correct reference key in the attention layer during training. Specifically, it is realized via a regularization loss on top of the attention map within a diffusion-based baseline. Our extensive experiments show that Leffa achieves state-of-the-art performance in controlling appearance (virtual try-on) and pose (pose transfer), significantly reducing fine-grained detail distortion while maintaining high image quality. Additionally, we show that our loss is model-agnostic and can be used to improve the performance of other diffusion models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised Outlier Detection (UOD) is a critical task in data mining and machine learning, aiming to identify instances that significantly deviate from the majority. Without any label, deep UOD methods struggle with the misalignment between the model's direct optimization goal and the final performance goal of Outlier Detection (OD) task. Through the perspective of training dynamics, this paper proposes an early stopping algorithm to optimize the training of deep UOD models, ensuring they perform optimally in OD rather than overfitting the entire contaminated dataset. Inspired by UOD mechanism and inlier priority phenomenon, where intuitively models fit inliers more quickly than outliers, we propose GradStop, a sampling-based label-free algorithm to estimate model's real-time performance during training. First, a sampling method generates two sets: one likely containing more outliers and the other more inliers, then a metric based on gradient cohesion is applied to probe into current training dynamics, which reflects model's performance on OD task. Experimental results on 4 deep UOD algorithms and 47 real-world datasets and theoretical proofs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed early stopping algorithm in enhancing the performance of deep UOD models. Auto Encoder (AE) enhanced by GradStop achieves better performance than itself, other SOTA UOD methods, and even ensemble AEs. Our method provides a robust and effective solution to the problem of performance degradation during training, enabling deep UOD models to achieve better potential in anomaly detection tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Comparative reviews are pivotal in understanding consumer preferences and influencing purchasing decisions. Comparative Quintuple Extraction (COQE) aims to identify five key components in text: the target entity, compared entities, compared aspects, opinions on these aspects, and polarity. Extracting precise comparative information from product reviews is challenging due to nuanced language and sequential task errors in traditional methods. To mitigate these problems, we propose MTP-COQE, an end-to-end model designed for COQE. Leveraging multi-perspective prompt-based learning, MTP-COQE effectively guides the generative model in comparative opinion mining tasks. Evaluation on the Camera-COQE (English) and VCOM (Vietnamese) datasets demonstrates MTP-COQE's efficacy in automating COQE, achieving superior performance with a 1.41% higher F1 score than the previous baseline models on the English dataset. Additionally, we designed a strategy to limit the generative model's creativity to ensure the output meets expectations. We also performed data augmentation to address data imbalance and to prevent the model from becoming biased towards dominant samples.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) models are increasingly used to produce content across domains, including text, images, and audio. While these models represent a major technical breakthrough, they gain their generative capabilities from being trained on enormous amounts of human-generated content, which often includes copyrighted material. In this work, we investigate whether audio watermarking techniques can be used to detect an unauthorized usage of content to train a music generation model. We compare outputs generated by a model trained on watermarked data to a model trained on non-watermarked data. We study factors that impact the model's generation behaviour: the watermarking technique, the proportion of watermarked samples in the training set, and the robustness of the watermarking technique against the model's tokenizer. Our results show that audio watermarking techniques, including some that are imperceptible to humans, can lead to noticeable shifts in the model's outputs. We also study the robustness of a state-of-the-art watermarking technique to removal techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Offline reinforcement learning has shown tremendous success in behavioral planning by learning from previously collected demonstrations. However, decision-making in multitask missions still presents significant challenges. For instance, a mission might require an agent to explore an unknown environment, discover goals, and navigate to them, even if it involves interacting with obstacles along the way. Such behavioral planning problems are difficult to solve due to: a) agents failing to adapt beyond the single task learned through their reward function, and b) the inability to generalize to new environments not covered in the training demonstrations, e.g., environments where all doors were unlocked in the demonstrations. Consequently, state-of-the-art decision making methods are limited to missions where the required tasks are well-represented in the training demonstrations and can be solved within a short (temporal) planning horizon. To address this, we propose GenPlan: a stochastic and adaptive planner that leverages discrete-flow models for generative sequence modeling, enabling sample-efficient exploration and exploitation. This framework relies on an iterative denoising procedure to generate a sequence of goals and actions. This approach captures multi-modal action distributions and facilitates goal and task discovery, thereby enhancing generalization to out-of-distribution tasks and environments, i.e., missions not part of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through multiple simulation environments. Notably, GenPlan outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by over 10% on adaptive planning tasks, where the agent adapts to multi-task missions while leveraging demonstrations on single-goal-reaching tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The fashion industry is increasingly leveraging computer vision and deep learning technologies to enhance online shopping experiences and operational efficiencies. In this paper, we address the challenge of generating high-fidelity tiled garment images essential for personalized recommendations, outfit composition, and virtual try-on systems from photos of garments worn by models. Inspired by the success of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in image-to-image translation, we propose a novel approach utilizing a fine-tuned StableDiffusion model. Our method features a streamlined single-stage network design, which integrates garmentspecific masks to isolate and process target clothing items effectively. By simplifying the network architecture through selective training of transformer blocks and removing unnecessary crossattention layers, we significantly reduce computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets like VITON-HD. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in producing high-quality tiled garment images for both full-body and half-body inputs.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have shown remarkable success in producing high-quality images from text. However, existing T2I models show decayed performance in compositional image generation involving multiple objects and intricate relationships. We attribute this problem to limitations in existing datasets of image-text pairs, which lack precise inter-object relationship annotations with prompts only. To address this problem, we construct LAION-SG, a large-scale dataset with high-quality structural annotations of scene graphs (SG), which precisely describe attributes and relationships of multiple objects, effectively representing the semantic structure in complex scenes. Based on LAION-SG, we train a new foundation model SDXL-SG to incorporate structural annotation information into the generation process. Extensive experiments show advanced models trained on our LAION-SG boast significant performance improvements in complex scene generation over models on existing datasets. We also introduce CompSG-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates models on compositional image generation, establishing a new standard for this domain.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Editing real images using a pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion/flow model often involves inverting the image into its corresponding noise map. However, inversion by itself is typically insufficient for obtaining satisfactory results, and therefore many methods additionally intervene in the sampling process. Such methods achieve improved results but are not seamlessly transferable between model architectures. Here, we introduce FlowEdit, a text-based editing method for pre-trained T2I flow models, which is inversion-free, optimization-free and model agnostic. Our method constructs an ODE that directly maps between the source and target distributions (corresponding to the source and target text prompts) and achieves a lower transport cost than the inversion approach. This leads to state-of-the-art results, as we illustrate with Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX. Code and examples are available on the project's webpage.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal generative models require a unified approach to handle both discrete data (e.g., text and code) and continuous data (e.g., image, audio, video). In this work, we propose Latent Language Modeling (LatentLM), which seamlessly integrates continuous and discrete data using causal Transformers. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to represent continuous data as latent vectors and introduce next-token diffusion for autoregressive generation of these vectors. Additionally, we develop $\sigma$-VAE to address the challenges of variance collapse, which is crucial for autoregressive modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LatentLM across various modalities. In image generation, LatentLM surpasses Diffusion Transformers in both performance and scalability. When integrated into multimodal large language models, LatentLM provides a general-purpose interface that unifies multimodal generation and understanding. Experimental results show that LatentLM achieves favorable performance compared to Transfusion and vector quantized models in the setting of scaling up training tokens. In text-to-speech synthesis, LatentLM outperforms the state-of-the-art VALL-E 2 model in speaker similarity and robustness, while requiring 10x fewer decoding steps. The results establish LatentLM as a highly effective and scalable approach to advance large multimodal models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Identifying the training data samples that most influence a generated image is a critical task in understanding diffusion models, yet existing influence estimation methods are constrained to small-scale or LoRA-tuned models due to computational limitations. As diffusion models scale up, these methods become impractical. To address this challenge, we propose DMin (Diffusion Model influence), a scalable framework for estimating the influence of each training data sample on a given generated image. By leveraging efficient gradient compression and retrieval techniques, DMin reduces storage requirements from 339.39 TB to only 726 MB and retrieves the top-k most influential training samples in under 1 second, all while maintaining performance. Our empirical results demonstrate DMin is both effective in identifying influential training samples and efficient in terms of computational and storage requirements.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly, yet aligning complex textual prompts with generated visuals remains challenging, especially with intricate object relationships and fine-grained details. This paper introduces Fast Prompt Alignment (FPA), a prompt optimization framework that leverages a one-pass approach, enhancing text-to-image alignment efficiency without the iterative overhead typical of current methods like OPT2I. FPA uses large language models (LLMs) for single-iteration prompt paraphrasing, followed by fine-tuning or in-context learning with optimized prompts to enable real-time inference, reducing computational demands while preserving alignment fidelity. Extensive evaluations on the COCO Captions and PartiPrompts datasets demonstrate that FPA achieves competitive text-image alignment scores at a fraction of the processing time, as validated through both automated metrics (TIFA, VQA) and human evaluation. A human study with expert annotators further reveals a strong correlation between human alignment judgments and automated scores, underscoring the robustness of FPA's improvements. The proposed method showcases a scalable, efficient alternative to iterative prompt optimization, enabling broader applicability in real-time, high-demand settings.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modeling the evolutions of driving scenarios is important for the evaluation and decision-making of autonomous driving systems. Most existing methods focus on one aspect of scene evolution such as map generation, motion prediction, and trajectory planning. In this paper, we propose a unified Generative Pre-training for Driving (GPD-1) model to accomplish all these tasks altogether without additional fine-tuning. We represent each scene with ego, agent, and map tokens and formulate autonomous driving as a unified token generation problem. We adopt the autoregressive transformer architecture and use a scene-level attention mask to enable intra-scene bi-directional interactions. For the ego and agent tokens, we propose a hierarchical positional tokenizer to effectively encode both 2D positions and headings. For the map tokens, we train a map vector-quantized autoencoder to efficiently compress ego-centric semantic maps into discrete tokens. We pre-train our GPD-1 on the large-scale nuPlan dataset and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its effectiveness. With different prompts, our GPD-1 successfully generalizes to various tasks without finetuning, including scene generation, traffic simulation, closed-loop simulation, map prediction, and motion planning.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces a tuning-free method for both object insertion and subject-driven generation. The task involves composing an object, given multiple views, into a scene specified by either an image or text. Existing methods struggle to fully meet the task's challenging objectives: (i) seamlessly composing the object into the scene with photorealistic pose and lighting, and (ii) preserving the object's identity. We hypothesize that achieving these goals requires large scale supervision, but manually collecting sufficient data is simply too expensive. The key observation in this paper is that many mass-produced objects recur across multiple images of large unlabeled datasets, in different scenes, poses, and lighting conditions. We use this observation to create massive supervision by retrieving sets of diverse views of the same object. This powerful paired dataset enables us to train a straightforward text-to-image diffusion architecture to map the object and scene descriptions to the composited image. We compare our method, ObjectMate, with state-of-the-art methods for object insertion and subject-driven generation, using a single or multiple references. Empirically, ObjectMate achieves superior identity preservation and more photorealistic composition. Differently from many other multi-reference methods, ObjectMate does not require slow test-time tuning.</li>
