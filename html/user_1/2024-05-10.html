<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly detection is critical for the secure and reliable operation of industrial control systems. As our reliance on such complex cyber-physical systems grows, it becomes paramount to have automated methods for detecting anomalies, preventing attacks, and responding intelligently. {This paper presents a novel deep generative model to meet this need. The proposed model follows a variational autoencoder architecture with a convolutional encoder and decoder to extract features from both spatial and temporal dimensions. Additionally, we incorporate an attention mechanism that directs focus towards specific regions, enhancing the representation of relevant features and improving anomaly detection accuracy. We also employ a dynamic threshold approach leveraging the reconstruction probability and make our source code publicly available to promote reproducibility and facilitate further research. Comprehensive experimental analysis is conducted on data from all six stages of the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) testbed, and the experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to several state-of-the-art baseline techniques.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Phishing email attacks are among the most common and most harmful cybersecurity attacks. With the emergence of generative AI, phishing attacks can be based on emails generated automatically, making it more difficult to detect them. That is, instead of a single email format sent to a large number of recipients, generative AI can be used to send each potential victim a different email, making it more difficult for cybersecurity systems to identify the scam email before it reaches the recipient. Here we describe a corpus of AI-generated phishing emails. We also use different machine learning tools to test the ability of automatic text analysis to identify AI-generated phishing emails. The results are encouraging, and show that machine learning tools can identify an AI-generated phishing email with high accuracy compared to regular emails or human-generated scam email. By applying descriptive analytic, the specific differences between AI-generated emails and manually crafted scam emails are profiled, and show that AI-generated emails are different in their style from human-generated phishing email scams. Therefore, automatic identification tools can be used as a warning for the user. The paper also describes the corpus of AI-generated phishing emails that is made open to the public, and can be used for consequent studies. While the ability of machine learning to detect AI-generated phishing email is encouraging, AI-generated phishing emails are different from regular phishing emails, and therefore it is important to train machine learning systems also with AI-generated emails in order to repel future phishing attacks that are powered by generative AI.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose the characteristic generator, a novel one-step generative model that combines the efficiency of sampling in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the stable performance of flow-based models. Our model is driven by characteristics, along which the probability density transport can be described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Specifically, We estimate the velocity field through nonparametric regression and utilize Euler method to solve the probability flow ODE, generating a series of discrete approximations to the characteristics. We then use a deep neural network to fit these characteristics, ensuring a one-step mapping that effectively pushes the prior distribution towards the target distribution. In the theoretical aspect, we analyze the errors in velocity matching, Euler discretization, and characteristic fitting to establish a non-asymptotic convergence rate for the characteristic generator in 2-Wasserstein distance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough analysis for simulation-free one step generative models. Additionally, our analysis refines the error analysis of flow-based generative models in prior works. We apply our method on both synthetic and real datasets, and the results demonstrate that the characteristic generator achieves high generation quality with just a single evaluation of neural network.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Temporal information plays a pivotal role in Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) driving scene understanding, which can alleviate the visual information sparsity. However, the indiscriminate temporal fusion method will cause the barrier of feature redundancy when constructing vectorized High-Definition (HD) maps. In this paper, we revisit the temporal fusion of vectorized HD maps, focusing on temporal instance consistency and temporal map consistency learning. To improve the representation of instances in single-frame maps, we introduce a novel method, DTCLMapper. This approach uses a dual-stream temporal consistency learning module that combines instance embedding with geometry maps. In the instance embedding component, our approach integrates temporal Instance Consistency Learning (ICL), ensuring consistency from vector points and instance features aggregated from points. A vectorized points pre-selection module is employed to enhance the regression efficiency of vector points from each instance. Then aggregated instance features obtained from the vectorized points preselection module are grounded in contrastive learning to realize temporal consistency, where positive and negative samples are selected based on position and semantic information. The geometry mapping component introduces Map Consistency Learning (MCL) designed with self-supervised learning. The MCL enhances the generalization capability of our consistent learning approach by concentrating on the global location and distribution constraints of the instances. Extensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks indicate that the proposed DTCLMapper achieves state-of-the-art performance in vectorized mapping tasks, reaching 61.9% and 65.1% mAP scores on the nuScenes and Argoverse datasets, respectively.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in generative models have significantly impacted content creation, leading to the emergence of Personalized Content Synthesis (PCS). With a small set of user-provided examples, PCS aims to customize the subject of interest to specific user-defined prompts. Over the past two years, more than 150 methods have been proposed. However, existing surveys mainly focus on text-to-image generation, with few providing up-to-date summaries on PCS. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of PCS, with a particular focus on the diffusion models. Specifically, we introduce the generic frameworks of PCS research, which can be broadly classified into optimization-based and learning-based approaches. We further categorize and analyze these methodologies, discussing their strengths, limitations, and key techniques. Additionally, we delve into specialized tasks within the field, such as personalized object generation, face synthesis, and style personalization, highlighting their unique challenges and innovations. Despite encouraging progress, we also present an analysis of the challenges such as overfitting and the trade-off between subject fidelity and text alignment. Through this detailed overview and analysis, we propose future directions to advance the development of PCS.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The intrinsic capability to perceive depth of field and extract salient information by the Human Vision System (HVS) stimulates a pilot to perform manual landing over an autoland approach. However, harsh weather creates visibility hindrances, and a pilot must have a clear view of runway elements before the minimum decision altitude. To help a pilot in manual landing, a vision-based system tailored to localize runway elements likewise gets affected, especially during crosswind due to the projective distortion of aircraft camera images. To combat this, we propose to integrate a prompt-based climatic diffusion network with a weather distillation model using a novel diffusion-distillation loss. Precisely, the diffusion model synthesizes climatic-conditioned landing images, and the weather distillation model learns inverse mapping by clearing those visual degradations. Then, to tackle the crosswind landing scenario, a novel Regularized Spatial Transformer Networks (RuSTaN) learns to accurately calibrate for projective distortion using self-supervised learning, which minimizes localization error by the downstream runway object detector. Finally, we have simulated a clear-day landing scenario at the busiest airport globally to curate an image-based Aircraft Landing Dataset (AIRLAD) and experimentally validated our contributions using this dataset to benchmark the performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Molecular representation learning has shown great success in advancing AI-based drug discovery. The core of many recent works is based on the fact that the 3D geometric structure of molecules provides essential information about their physical and chemical characteristics. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have achieved impressive performance in 3D molecular representation learning. However, most existing molecular diffusion models treat each atom as an independent entity, overlooking the dependency among atoms within the molecular substructures. This paper introduces a novel approach that enhances molecular representation learning by incorporating substructural information within the diffusion process. We propose a novel diffusion model termed SubGDiff for involving the molecular subgraph information in diffusion. Specifically, SubGDiff adopts three vital techniques: i) subgraph prediction, ii) expectation state, and iii) k-step same subgraph diffusion, to enhance the perception of molecular substructure in the denoising network. Experimentally, extensive downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. The code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Thanks to the powerful generative capacity of diffusion models, recent years have witnessed rapid progress in human motion generation. Existing diffusion-based methods employ disparate network architectures and training strategies. The effect of the design of each component is still unclear. In addition, the iterative denoising process consumes considerable computational overhead, which is prohibitive for real-time scenarios such as virtual characters and humanoid robots. For this reason, we first conduct a comprehensive investigation into network architectures, training strategies, and inference processs. Based on the profound analysis, we tailor each component for efficient high-quality human motion generation. Despite the promising performance, the tailored model still suffers from foot skating which is an ubiquitous issue in diffusion-based solutions. To eliminate footskate, we identify foot-ground contact and correct foot motions along the denoising process. By organically combining these well-designed components together, we present StableMoFusion, a robust and efficient framework for human motion generation. Extensive experimental results show that our StableMoFusion performs favorably against current state-of-the-art methods. Project page: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While current research predominantly focuses on image-based colorization, the domain of video-based colorization remains relatively unexplored. Most existing video colorization techniques operate on a frame-by-frame basis, often overlooking the critical aspect of temporal coherence between successive frames. This approach can result in inconsistencies across frames, leading to undesirable effects like flickering or abrupt color transitions between frames. To address these challenges, we harness the generative capabilities of a fine-tuned latent diffusion model designed specifically for video colorization, introducing a novel solution for achieving temporal consistency in video colorization, as well as demonstrating strong improvements on established image quality metrics compared to other existing methods. Furthermore, we perform a subjective study, where users preferred our approach to the existing state of the art. Our dataset encompasses a combination of conventional datasets and videos from television/movies. In short, by leveraging the power of a fine-tuned latent diffusion-based colorization system with a temporal consistency mechanism, we can improve the performance of automatic video colorization by addressing the challenges of temporal inconsistency. A short demonstration of our results can be seen in some example videos available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Element segmentation is a key step in nondestructive testing of Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) based on Computed Tomography (CT) technology. In recent years, the rapid development of self-supervised pretraining technology can obtain general image features without labeled samples, and then use a small amount of labeled samples to solve downstream tasks, which has a good potential in PCB element segmentation. At present, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) pretraining model has been initially applied in PCB CT image element segmentation. However, due to the small and regular size of PCB elements such as vias, wires, and pads, the global visual field has redundancy for a single element reconstruction, which may damage the performance of the model. Based on this issue, we propose an efficient pretraining model based on multi-scale local visual field feature reconstruction for PCB CT image element segmentation (EMLR-seg). In this model, the teacher-guided MIM pretraining model is introduced into PCB CT image element segmentation for the first time, and a multi-scale local visual field extraction (MVE) module is proposed to reduce redundancy by focusing on local visual fields. At the same time, a simple 4-Transformer-blocks decoder is used. Experiments show that EMLR-seg can achieve 88.6% mIoU on the PCB CT image dataset we proposed, which exceeds 1.2% by the baseline model, and the training time is reduced by 29.6 hours, a reduction of 17.4% under the same experimental condition, which reflects the advantage of EMLR-seg in terms of performance and efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Audio-driven talking head generation is advancing from 2D to 3D content. Notably, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is in the spotlight as a means to synthesize high-quality 3D talking head outputs. Unfortunately, this NeRF-based approach typically requires a large number of paired audio-visual data for each identity, thereby limiting the scalability of the method. Although there have been attempts to generate audio-driven 3D talking head animations with a single image, the results are often unsatisfactory due to insufficient information on obscured regions in the image. In this paper, we mainly focus on addressing the overlooked aspect of 3D consistency in the one-shot, audio-driven domain, where facial animations are synthesized primarily in front-facing perspectives. We propose a novel method, NeRFFaceSpeech, which enables to produce high-quality 3D-aware talking head. Using prior knowledge of generative models combined with NeRF, our method can craft a 3D-consistent facial feature space corresponding to a single image. Our spatial synchronization method employs audio-correlated vertex dynamics of a parametric face model to transform static image features into dynamic visuals through ray deformation, ensuring realistic 3D facial motion. Moreover, we introduce LipaintNet that can replenish the lacking information in the inner-mouth area, which can not be obtained from a given single image. The network is trained in a self-supervised manner by utilizing the generative capabilities without additional data. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in generating audio-driven talking heads from a single image with enhanced 3D consistency compared to previous approaches. In addition, we introduce a quantitative way of measuring the robustness of a model against pose changes for the first time, which has been possible only qualitatively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detail features of magnetic resonance images play a cru-cial role in accurate medical diagnosis and treatment, as they capture subtle changes that pose challenges for doc-tors when performing precise judgments. However, the widely utilized naive diffusion model has limitations, as it fails to accurately capture more intricate details. To en-hance the quality of MRI reconstruction, we propose a comprehensive detail-preserving reconstruction method using multiple diffusion models to extract structure and detail features in k-space domain instead of image do-main. Moreover, virtual binary modal masks are utilized to refine the range of values in k-space data through highly adaptive center windows, which allows the model to focus its attention more efficiently. Last but not least, an inverted pyramid structure is employed, where the top-down image information gradually decreases, ena-bling a cascade representation. The framework effective-ly represents multi-scale sampled data, taking into ac-count the sparsity of the inverted pyramid architecture, and utilizes cascade training data distribution to repre-sent multi-scale data. Through a step-by-step refinement approach, the method refines the approximation of de-tails. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated by con-ducting experiments on clinical and public datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outper-forms other methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Artificial Intelligence Generative Content (AIGC) technologies have significantly influenced the remote sensing domain, particularly in the realm of image generation. However, remote sensing image editing, an equally vital research area, has not garnered sufficient attention. Different from text-guided editing in natural images, which relies on extensive text-image paired data for semantic correlation, the application scenarios of remote sensing image editing are often extreme, such as forest on fire, so it is difficult to obtain sufficient paired samples. At the same time, the lack of remote sensing semantics and the ambiguity of text also restrict the further application of image editing in remote sensing field. To solve above problems, this letter proposes a diffusion based method to fulfill stable and controllable remote sensing image editing with text guidance. Our method avoids the use of a large number of paired image, and can achieve good image editing results using only a single image. The quantitative evaluation system including CLIP score and subjective evaluation metrics shows that our method has better editing effect on remote sensing images than the existing image editing model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To fully understand the 3D context of a single image, a visual system must be able to segment both the visible and occluded regions of objects, while discerning their occlusion order. Ideally, the system should be able to handle any object and not be restricted to segmenting a limited set of object classes, especially in robotic applications. Addressing this need, we introduce a diffusion model with cumulative occlusion learning designed for sequential amodal segmentation of objects with uncertain categories. This model iteratively refines the prediction using the cumulative mask strategy during diffusion, effectively capturing the uncertainty of invisible regions and adeptly reproducing the complex distribution of shapes and occlusion orders of occluded objects. It is akin to the human capability for amodal perception, i.e., to decipher the spatial ordering among objects and accurately predict complete contours for occluded objects in densely layered visual scenes. Experimental results across three amodal datasets show that our method outperforms established baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown significant success in personalized text-to-image generation, which aims to generate novel images with human identities indicated by the reference images. Despite promising identity fidelity has been achieved by several tuning-free methods, they usually suffer from overfitting issues. The learned identity tends to entangle with irrelevant information, resulting in unsatisfied text controllability, especially on faces. In this work, we present MasterWeaver, a test-time tuning-free method designed to generate personalized images with both faithful identity fidelity and flexible editability. Specifically, MasterWeaver adopts an encoder to extract identity features and steers the image generation through additional introduced cross attention. To improve editability while maintaining identity fidelity, we propose an editing direction loss for training, which aligns the editing directions of our MasterWeaver with those of the original T2I model. Additionally, a face-augmented dataset is constructed to facilitate disentangled identity learning, and further improve the editability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MasterWeaver can not only generate personalized images with faithful identity, but also exhibit superiority in text controllability.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In text recognition, self-supervised pre-training emerges as a good solution to reduce dependence on expansive annotated real data. Previous studies primarily focus on local visual representation by leveraging mask image modeling or sequence contrastive learning. However, they omit modeling the linguistic information in text images, which is crucial for recognizing text. To simultaneously capture local character features and linguistic information in visual space, we propose Symmetric Superimposition Modeling (SSM). The objective of SSM is to reconstruct the direction-specific pixel and feature signals from the symmetrically superimposed input. Specifically, we add the original image with its inverted views to create the symmetrically superimposed inputs. At the pixel level, we reconstruct the original and inverted images to capture character shapes and texture-level linguistic context. At the feature level, we reconstruct the feature of the same original image and inverted image with different augmentations to model the semantic-level linguistic context and the local character discrimination. In our design, we disrupt the character shape and linguistic rules. Consequently, the dual-level reconstruction facilitates understanding character shapes and linguistic information from the perspective of visual texture and feature semantics. Experiments on various text recognition benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of SSM, with 4.1% average performance gains and 86.6% new state-of-the-art average word accuracy on Union14M benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The past few years have witnessed substantial advancement in text-guided image generation powered by diffusion models. However, it was shown that text-to-image diffusion models are vulnerable to training image memorization, raising concerns on copyright infringement and privacy invasion. In this work, we perform practical analysis of memorization in text-to-image diffusion models. Targeting a set of images to protect, we conduct quantitive analysis on them without need to collect any prompts. Specifically, we first formally define the memorization of image and identify three necessary conditions of memorization, respectively similarity, existence and probability. We then reveal the correlation between the model's prediction error and image replication. Based on the correlation, we propose to utilize inversion techniques to verify the safety of target images against memorization and measure the extent to which they are memorized. Model developers can utilize our analysis method to discover memorized images or reliably claim safety against memorization. Extensive experiments on the Stable Diffusion, a popular open-source text-to-image diffusion model, demonstrate the effectiveness of our analysis method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Embodied AI agents require a fine-grained understanding of the physical world mediated through visual and language inputs. Such capabilities are difficult to learn solely from task-specific data. This has led to the emergence of pre-trained vision-language models as a tool for transferring representations learned from internet-scale data to downstream tasks and new domains. However, commonly used contrastively trained representations such as in CLIP have been shown to fail at enabling embodied agents to gain a sufficiently fine-grained scene understanding -- a capability vital for control. To address this shortcoming, we consider representations from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, which are explicitly optimized to generate images from text prompts and as such, contain text-conditioned representations that reflect highly fine-grained visuo-spatial information. Using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, we construct Stable Control Representations which allow learning downstream control policies that generalize to complex, open-ended environments. We show that policies learned using Stable Control Representations are competitive with state-of-the-art representation learning approaches across a broad range of simulated control settings, encompassing challenging manipulation and navigation tasks. Most notably, we show that Stable Control Representations enable learning policies that exhibit state-of-the-art performance on OVMM, a difficult open-vocabulary navigation benchmark.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the rare occurrence of anomalous events, a typical approach to anomaly detection is to train an autoencoder (AE) with normal data only so that it learns the patterns or representations of the normal training data. At test time, the trained AE is expected to well reconstruct normal but to poorly reconstruct anomalous data. However, contrary to the expectation, anomalous data is often well reconstructed as well. In order to further separate the reconstruction quality between normal and anomalous data, we propose creating pseudo anomalies from learned adaptive noise by exploiting the aforementioned weakness of AE, i.e., reconstructing anomalies too well. The generated noise is added to the normal data to create pseudo anomalies. Extensive experiments on Ped2, Avenue, ShanghaiTech, CIFAR-10, and KDDCUP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generic applicability of our approach in improving the discriminative capability of AEs for anomaly detection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>AI-generated content (AIGC) models, represented by large language models (LLM), have brought revolutionary changes to the content generation fields. The high-speed and extensive 6G technology is an ideal platform for providing powerful AIGC mobile service applications, while future 6G mobile networks also need to support intelligent and personalized mobile generation services. However, the significant ethical and security issues of current AIGC models, such as adversarial attacks, privacy, and fairness, greatly affect the credibility of 6G intelligent networks, especially in ensuring secure, private, and fair AIGC applications. In this paper, we propose TrustGAIN, a novel paradigm for trustworthy AIGC in 6G networks, to ensure trustworthy large-scale AIGC services in future 6G networks. We first discuss the adversarial attacks and privacy threats faced by AIGC systems in 6G networks, as well as the corresponding protection issues. Subsequently, we emphasize the importance of ensuring the unbiasedness and fairness of the mobile generative service in future intelligent networks. In particular, we conduct a use case to demonstrate that TrustGAIN can effectively guide the resistance against malicious or generated false information. We believe that TrustGAIN is a necessary paradigm for intelligent and trustworthy 6G networks to support AIGC services, ensuring the security, privacy, and fairness of AIGC network services.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sora unveils the potential of scaling Diffusion Transformer for generating photorealistic images and videos at arbitrary resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, yet it still lacks sufficient implementation details. In this technical report, we introduce the Lumina-T2X family - a series of Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformers (Flag-DiT) equipped with zero-initialized attention, as a unified framework designed to transform noise into images, videos, multi-view 3D objects, and audio clips conditioned on text instructions. By tokenizing the latent spatial-temporal space and incorporating learnable placeholders such as [nextline] and [nextframe] tokens, Lumina-T2X seamlessly unifies the representations of different modalities across various spatial-temporal resolutions. This unified approach enables training within a single framework for different modalities and allows for flexible generation of multimodal data at any resolution, aspect ratio, and length during inference. Advanced techniques like RoPE, RMSNorm, and flow matching enhance the stability, flexibility, and scalability of Flag-DiT, enabling models of Lumina-T2X to scale up to 7 billion parameters and extend the context window to 128K tokens. This is particularly beneficial for creating ultra-high-definition images with our Lumina-T2I model and long 720p videos with our Lumina-T2V model. Remarkably, Lumina-T2I, powered by a 5-billion-parameter Flag-DiT, requires only 35% of the training computational costs of a 600-million-parameter naive DiT. Our further comprehensive analysis underscores Lumina-T2X's preliminary capability in resolution extrapolation, high-resolution editing, generating consistent 3D views, and synthesizing videos with seamless transitions. We expect that the open-sourcing of Lumina-T2X will further foster creativity, transparency, and diversity in the generative AI community.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent work in Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) tries to formulate VFI as a diffusion-based conditional image generation problem, synthesizing the intermediate frame given a random noise and neighboring frames. Due to the relatively high resolution of videos, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are employed as the conditional generation model, where the autoencoder compresses images into latent representations for diffusion and then reconstructs images from these latent representations. Such a formulation poses a crucial challenge: VFI expects that the output is deterministically equal to the ground truth intermediate frame, but LDMs randomly generate a diverse set of different images when the model runs multiple times. The reason for the diverse generation is that the cumulative variance (variance accumulated at each step of generation) of generated latent representations in LDMs is large. This makes the sampling trajectory random, resulting in diverse rather than deterministic generations. To address this problem, we propose our unique solution: Frame Interpolation with Consecutive Brownian Bridge Diffusion. Specifically, we propose consecutive Brownian Bridge diffusion that takes a deterministic initial value as input, resulting in a much smaller cumulative variance of generated latent representations. Our experiments suggest that our method can improve together with the improvement of the autoencoder and achieve state-of-the-art performance in VFI, leaving strong potential for further enhancement.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, self-supervised, generative, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Time Series Representation Learning (TSRL) focuses on generating informative representations for various Time Series (TS) modeling tasks. Traditional Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods in TSRL fall into four main categories: reconstructive, adversarial, contrastive, and predictive, each with a common challenge of sensitivity to noise and intricate data nuances. Recently, diffusion-based methods have shown advanced generative capabilities. However, they primarily target specific application scenarios like imputation and forecasting, leaving a gap in leveraging diffusion models for generic TSRL. Our work, Time Series Diffusion Embedding (TSDE), bridges this gap as the first diffusion-based SSL TSRL approach. TSDE segments TS data into observed and masked parts using an Imputation-Interpolation-Forecasting (IIF) mask. It applies a trainable embedding function, featuring dual-orthogonal Transformer encoders with a crossover mechanism, to the observed part. We train a reverse diffusion process conditioned on the embeddings, designed to predict noise added to the masked part. Extensive experiments demonstrate TSDE's superiority in imputation, interpolation, forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and clustering. We also conduct an ablation study, present embedding visualizations, and compare inference speed, further substantiating TSDE's efficiency and validity in learning representations of TS data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a method to distill a complex multistep diffusion model into a single-step conditional GAN student model, dramatically accelerating inference, while preserving image quality. Our approach interprets diffusion distillation as a paired image-to-image translation task, using noise-to-image pairs of the diffusion model's ODE trajectory. For efficient regression loss computation, we propose E-LatentLPIPS, a perceptual loss operating directly in diffusion model's latent space, utilizing an ensemble of augmentations. Furthermore, we adapt a diffusion model to construct a multi-scale discriminator with a text alignment loss to build an effective conditional GAN-based formulation. E-LatentLPIPS converges more efficiently than many existing distillation methods, even accounting for dataset construction costs. We demonstrate that our one-step generator outperforms cutting-edge one-step diffusion distillation models - DMD, SDXL-Turbo, and SDXL-Lightning - on the zero-shot COCO benchmark.</li>
