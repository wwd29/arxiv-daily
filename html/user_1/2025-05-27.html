<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increasing sophistication and integration of Generative AI (GenAI) models into diverse applications introduce new security challenges that traditional methods struggle to address. This research explores the critical need for proactive security measures to mitigate the risks associated with malicious exploitation of GenAI systems. We present a framework encompassing key approaches, tools, and strategies designed to outmaneuver even advanced adversarial attacks, emphasizing the importance of securing GenAI innovation against potential liabilities. We also empirically prove the effectiveness of the said framework by testing it against the SPML Chatbot Prompt Injection Dataset. This work highlights the shift from reactive to proactive security practices essential for the safe and responsible deployment of GenAI technologies</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present the GAIA (Geospatial Artificial Intelligence for Atmospheres) Foundation Model, a novel model that combines masked autoencoders (MAE) and self-DIstillation with NO labels (DINO) for analyzing global atmospheric patterns in satellite imagery. By integrating these complementary self-supervised learning approaches, our model simultaneously captures both local features and global dependencies. We address two critical challenges in satellite data analysis: reconstructing missing regions and estimating precipitation patterns as our first downstream tasks. The model demonstrates superior temporal pattern capture compared to standard MAE approaches, while maintaining robust performance in downstream tasks. Our experimental results show strong gap-filling capabilities across varying mask ratios and accurate precipitation estimation with limited training data, achieving a false alarm ratio of 0.088 and structural similarity of 0.881. This work represents an advancement in self-supervised learning for atmospheric science, providing a foundation for improved weather monitoring and climate analysis.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating realistic brain connectivity matrices is key to analyzing population heterogeneity in brain organization, understanding disease, and augmenting data in challenging classification problems. Functional connectivity matrices lie in constrained spaces--such as the set of symmetric positive definite or correlation matrices--that can be modeled as Riemannian manifolds. However, using Riemannian tools typically requires redefining core operations (geodesics, norms, integration), making generative modeling computationally inefficient. In this work, we propose DiffeoCFM, an approach that enables conditional flow matching (CFM) on matrix manifolds by exploiting pullback metrics induced by global diffeomorphisms on Euclidean spaces. We show that Riemannian CFM with such metrics is equivalent to applying standard CFM after data transformation. This equivalence allows efficient vector field learning, and fast sampling with standard ODE solvers. We instantiate DiffeoCFM with two different settings: the matrix logarithm for covariance matrices and the normalized Cholesky decomposition for correlation matrices. We evaluate DiffeoCFM on three large-scale fMRI datasets with more than 4600 scans from 2800 subjects (ADNI, ABIDE, OASIS-3) and two EEG motor imagery datasets with over 30000 trials from 26 subjects (BNCI2014-002 and BNCI2015-001). It enables fast training and achieves state-of-the-art performance, all while preserving manifold constraints.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In Transformer architectures, tokens\textemdash discrete units derived from raw data\textemdash are formed by segmenting inputs into fixed-length chunks. Each token is then mapped to an embedding, enabling parallel attention computations while preserving the input's essential information. Due to the quadratic computational complexity of transformer self-attention mechanisms, token reduction has primarily been used as an efficiency strategy. This is especially true in single vision and language domains, where it helps balance computational costs, memory usage, and inference latency. Despite these advances, this paper argues that token reduction should transcend its traditional efficiency-oriented role in the era of large generative models. Instead, we position it as a fundamental principle in generative modeling, critically influencing both model architecture and broader applications. Specifically, we contend that across vision, language, and multimodal systems, token reduction can: (i) facilitate deeper multimodal integration and alignment, (ii) mitigate "overthinking" and hallucinations, (iii) maintain coherence over long inputs, and (iv) enhance training stability, etc. We reframe token reduction as more than an efficiency measure. By doing so, we outline promising future directions, including algorithm design, reinforcement learning-guided token reduction, token optimization for in-context learning, and broader ML and scientific domains. We highlight its potential to drive new model architectures and learning strategies that improve robustness, increase interpretability, and better align with the objectives of generative modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>What is the shortest path between two data points lying in a high-dimensional space? While the answer is trivial in Euclidean geometry, it becomes significantly more complex when the data lies on a curved manifold -- requiring a Riemannian metric to describe the space's local curvature. Estimating such a metric, however, remains a major challenge in high dimensions. In this work, we propose a method for deriving Riemannian metrics directly from pretrained Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- a class of generative models that assign low energy to high-density regions. These metrics define spatially varying distances, enabling the computation of geodesics -- shortest paths that follow the data manifold's intrinsic geometry. We introduce two novel metrics derived from EBMs and show that they produce geodesics that remain closer to the data manifold and exhibit lower curvature distortion, as measured by alignment with ground-truth trajectories. We evaluate our approach on increasingly complex datasets: synthetic datasets with known data density, rotated character images with interpretable geometry, and high-resolution natural images embedded in a pretrained VAE latent space. Our results show that EBM-derived metrics consistently outperform established baselines, especially in high-dimensional settings. Our work is the first to derive Riemannian metrics from EBMs, enabling data-aware geodesics and unlocking scalable, geometry-driven learning for generative modeling and simulation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The generation of presentation slides automatically is an important problem in the era of generative AI. This paper focuses on evaluating multimodal content in presentation slides that can effectively summarize a document and convey concepts to a broad audience. We introduce a benchmark dataset, RefSlides, consisting of human-made high-quality presentations that span various topics. Next, we propose a set of metrics to characterize different intrinsic properties of the content of a presentation and present REFLEX, an evaluation approach that generates scores and actionable feedback for these metrics. We achieve this by generating negative presentation samples with different degrees of metric-specific perturbations and use them to fine-tune LLMs. This reference-free evaluation technique does not require ground truth presentations during inference. Our extensive automated and human experiments demonstrate that our evaluation approach outperforms classical heuristic-based and state-of-the-art large language model-based evaluations in generating scores and explanations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study presents a novel approach for decomposing urban water demand patterns using Skewed Gaussian Distributions (SGD) to derive behavioral insights and support operational planning. Hourly demand profiles contain critical information for both long-term infrastructure design and daily operations, influencing network pressures, water quality, energy consumption, and overall reliability. By breaking down each daily demand curve into a baseline component and distinct peak components, the proposed SGD method characterizes each peak with interpretable parameters, including peak amplitude, timing (mean), spread (duration), and skewness (asymmetry), thereby reconstructing the observed pattern and uncovering latent usage dynamics. This detailed peak-level decomposition enables both operational applications, e.g. anomaly and leakage detection, real-time demand management, and strategic analyses, e.g. identifying behavioral shifts, seasonal influences, or policy impacts on consumption patterns. Unlike traditional symmetric Gaussian or purely statistical time-series models, SGDs explicitly capture asymmetric peak shapes such as sharp morning surges followed by gradual declines, improving the fidelity of synthetic pattern generation and enhancing the detection of irregular consumption behavior. The method is demonstrated on several real-world datasets, showing that SGD outperforms symmetric Gaussian models in reconstruction accuracy, reducing root-mean-square error by over 50% on average, while maintaining physical interpretability. The SGD framework can also be used to construct synthetic demand scenarios by designing daily peak profiles with chosen characteristics.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large multimodal foundation models, particularly in the domains of language and vision, have significantly advanced various tasks, including robotics, autonomous driving, information retrieval, and grounding. However, many of these models perceive objects as indivisible, overlooking the components that constitute them. Understanding these components and their associated affordances provides valuable insights into an object's functionality, which is fundamental for performing a wide range of tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel real-world benchmark, InstructPart, comprising hand-labeled part segmentation annotations and task-oriented instructions to evaluate the performance of current models in understanding and executing part-level tasks within everyday contexts. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that task-oriented part segmentation remains a challenging problem, even for state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In addition to our benchmark, we introduce a simple baseline that achieves a twofold performance improvement through fine-tuning with our dataset. With our dataset and benchmark, we aim to facilitate research on task-oriented part segmentation and enhance the applicability of VLMs across various domains, including robotics, virtual reality, information retrieval, and other related fields.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across vision, language, and scientific domains. Despite their empirical success, prior theoretical analyses of the sample complexity suffer from poor scaling with input data dimension or rely on unrealistic assumptions such as access to exact empirical risk minimizers. In this work, we provide a principled analysis of score estimation, establishing a sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$. Our approach leverages a structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical, approximation, and optimization errors, enabling us to eliminate the exponential dependence on neural network parameters that arises in prior analyses. It is the first such result which achieves sample complexity bounds without assuming access to the empirical risk minimizer of score function estimation loss.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recovers the optimal policy $\pi$ given historical observations of an agent. In practice, $\pi$ is modeled as a weighted version of the agent's behavior policy $\mu$, using a weight function $w$ working as a critic of the agent's behavior. Though recent approaches to offline RL based on diffusion models have exhibited promising results, the computation of the required scores is challenging due to their dependence on the unknown $w$. In this work, we alleviate this issue by constructing a diffusion over both the actions and the weights. With the proposed setting, the required scores are directly obtained from the diffusion model without learning extra networks. Our main conceptual contribution is a novel guidance method, where guidance (which is a function of $w$) comes from the same diffusion model, therefore, our proposal is termed Self-Weighted Guidance (SWG). We show that SWG generates samples from the desired distribution on toy examples and performs on par with state-of-the-art methods on D4RL's challenging environments, while maintaining a streamlined training pipeline. We further validate SWG through ablation studies on weight formulations and scalability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dataset distillation (DD) has witnessed significant progress in creating small datasets that encapsulate rich information from large original ones. Particularly, methods based on generative priors show promising performance, while maintaining computational efficiency and cross-architecture generalization. However, the generation process lacks explicit controllability for each sample. Previous distillation methods primarily match the real distribution from the perspective of the entire dataset, whereas overlooking concept completeness at the instance level. The missing or incorrectly represented object details cannot be efficiently compensated due to the constrained sample amount typical in DD settings. To this end, we propose incorporating the concept understanding of large language models (LLMs) to perform Concept-Informed Diffusion (CONCORD) for dataset distillation. Specifically, distinguishable and fine-grained concepts are retrieved based on category labels to inform the denoising process and refine essential object details. By integrating these concepts, the proposed method significantly enhances both the controllability and interpretability of the distilled image generation, without relying on pre-trained classifiers. We demonstrate the efficacy of CONCORD by achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K and its subsets. The code implementation is released in this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cochlear implant surgery is a treatment for individuals with severe hearing loss. It involves inserting an array of electrodes inside the cochlea to electrically stimulate the auditory nerve and restore hearing sensation. A crucial step in this procedure is mastoidectomy, a surgical intervention that removes part of the mastoid region of the temporal bone, providing a critical pathway to the cochlea for electrode placement. Accurate prediction of the mastoidectomy region from preoperative imaging assists presurgical planning, reduces surgical risks, and improves surgical outcomes. In previous work, a self-supervised network was introduced to predict the mastoidectomy region using only preoperative CT scans. While promising, the method suffered from suboptimal robustness, limiting its practical application. To address this limitation, we propose a novel weakly-supervised Mamba-based framework to predict accurate mastoidectomy regions directly from preoperative CT scans. Our approach utilizes a 3D T-Distribution loss function inspired by the Student-t distribution, which effectively handles the complex geometric variability inherent in mastoidectomy shapes. Weak supervision is achieved using the segmentation results from the prior self-supervised network to eliminate the need for manual data cleaning or labeling throughout the training process. The proposed method is extensively evaluated against state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating superior performance in predicting accurate and clinically relevant mastoidectomy regions. Our findings highlight the robustness and efficiency of the weakly-supervised learning framework with the proposed novel 3D T-Distribution loss.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We argue that in-context learning (ICL) predictably arises from standard self-supervised next-token pretraining, rather than being an exotic emergent property. This work establishes the foundational principles of this emergence by focusing on in-distribution ICL, demonstrating how models necessarily adapt to context when trained on token sequences, especially from non-ergodic sources. Our information-theoretic framework precisely predicts these in-distribution ICL dynamics (i.e., context-dependent loss reduction). We verify this with experiments using synthetic datasets of differing types of correlational structure, reproducing characteristic phenomena like phase transitions in training loss for induction head formation and power-law scaling of in-context loss. We further show that a model's in-context performance on any task is mathematically coupled to the ensemble of tasks seen in pretraining, offering a fundamental explanation, grounded in architecture- and modality-independent principles, for such inference-time learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models are increasingly becoming better autonomous programmers, raising the prospect that they could also automate dangerous offensive cyber-operations. Current frontier model audits probe the cybersecurity risks of such agents, but most fail to account for the degrees of freedom available to adversaries in the real world. In particular, with strong verifiers and financial incentives, agents for offensive cybersecurity are amenable to iterative improvement by would-be adversaries. We argue that assessments should take into account an expanded threat model in the context of cybersecurity, emphasizing the varying degrees of freedom that an adversary may possess in stateful and non-stateful environments within a fixed compute budget. We show that even with a relatively small compute budget (8 H100 GPU Hours in our study), adversaries can improve an agent's cybersecurity capability on InterCode CTF by more than 40\% relative to the baseline -- without any external assistance. These results highlight the need to evaluate agents' cybersecurity risk in a dynamic manner, painting a more representative picture of risk.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>De novo 3D molecule generation is a pivotal task in drug discovery. However, many recent geometric generative models struggle to produce high-quality 3D structures, even if they maintain 2D validity and topological stability. To tackle this issue and enhance the learning of effective molecular generation dynamics, we present Megalodon-a family of scalable transformer models. These models are enhanced with basic equivariant layers and trained using a joint continuous and discrete denoising co-design objective. We assess Megalodon's performance on established molecule generation benchmarks and introduce new 3D structure benchmarks that evaluate a model's capability to generate realistic molecular structures, particularly focusing on energetics. We show that Megalodon achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D molecule generation, conditional structure generation, and structure energy benchmarks using diffusion and flow matching. Furthermore, doubling the number of parameters in Megalodon to 40M significantly enhances its performance, generating up to 49x more valid large molecules and achieving energy levels that are 2-10x lower than those of the best prior generative models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent deep learning models demand larger datasets, driving the need for dataset distillation to create compact, cost-efficient datasets while maintaining performance. Due to the powerful image generation capability of diffusion, it has been introduced to this field for generating distilled images. In this paper, we systematically investigate issues present in current diffusion-based dataset distillation methods, including inaccurate distribution matching, distribution deviation with random noise, and separate sampling. Building on this, we propose D^3HR, a novel diffusion-based framework to generate distilled datasets with high representativeness. Specifically, we adopt DDIM inversion to map the latents of the full dataset from a low-normality latent domain to a high-normality Gaussian domain, preserving information and ensuring structural consistency to generate representative latents for the distilled dataset. Furthermore, we propose an efficient sampling scheme to better align the representative latents with the high-normality Gaussian distribution. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that D^3HR can achieve higher accuracy across different model architectures compared with state-of-the-art baselines in dataset distillation.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) and large multi-modal models (LMMs) require a massive amount of computational and memory resources. We propose a new framework to convert such LLMs/LMMs into a reduced-dimension latent structure. Our method extends a local activation-aware tensor decomposition to a global attention-aware joint tensor de-composition. Our framework can significantly improve the model accuracy over the existing model compression methods when reducing the latent dimension to realize computationally/memory-efficient LLMs/LLMs. We show the benefit on several benchmark including multi-modal reasoning tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have advanced image stylization significantly, yet two core challenges persist: (1) maintaining consistent stylization in complex scenes, particularly identity, composition, and fine details, and (2) preventing style degradation in image-to-image pipelines with style LoRAs. GPT-4o's exceptional stylization consistency highlights the performance gap between open-source methods and proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{OmniConsistency}, a universal consistency plugin leveraging large-scale Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). OmniConsistency contributes: (1) an in-context consistency learning framework trained on aligned image pairs for robust generalization; (2) a two-stage progressive learning strategy decoupling style learning from consistency preservation to mitigate style degradation; and (3) a fully plug-and-play design compatible with arbitrary style LoRAs under the Flux framework. Extensive experiments show that OmniConsistency significantly enhances visual coherence and aesthetic quality, achieving performance comparable to commercial state-of-the-art model GPT-4o.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To tackle the huge computational demand of large foundation models, activation-aware compression techniques without retraining have been introduced. However, since these rely on calibration data, domain shift may arise for unknown downstream tasks. With a computationally efficient calibration, activation-aware pruning can be executed for every prompt adaptively, yet achieving reduced complexity at inference. We formulate it as a mixture of micro-experts, called $\mu$-MoE. Several experiments demonstrate that $\mu$-MoE can dynamically adapt to task/prompt-dependent structured sparsity on the fly.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced latent reasoning as a promising alternative to autoregressive reasoning. By performing internal computation with hidden states from previous steps, latent reasoning benefit from more informative features rather than sampling a discrete chain-of-thought (CoT) path. Yet latent reasoning approaches are often incompatible with LLMs, as their continuous paradigm conflicts with the discrete nature of autoregressive generation. Moreover, these methods rely on CoT traces for training and thus fail to exploit the inherent reasoning patterns of LLMs. In this work, we explore latent reasoning by leveraging the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). To this end, we introduce hybrid reasoning policy optimization (HRPO), an RL-based hybrid latent reasoning approach that (1) integrates prior hidden states into sampled tokens with a learnable gating mechanism, and (2) initializes training with predominantly token embeddings while progressively incorporating more hidden features. This design maintains LLMs' generative capabilities and incentivizes hybrid reasoning using both discrete and continuous representations. In addition, the hybrid HRPO introduces stochasticity into latent reasoning via token sampling, thereby enabling RL-based optimization without requiring CoT trajectories. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks show that HRPO outperforms prior methods in both knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks. Furthermore, HRPO-trained LLMs remain interpretable and exhibit intriguing behaviors like cross-lingual patterns and shorter completion lengths, highlighting the potential of our RL-based approach and offer insights for future work in latent reasoning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) promise parallel generation and bidirectional context, yet they underperform autoregressive (AR) models in both likelihood modeling and generated text quality. We identify that this performance gap arises when important tokens (e.g., key words or low-frequency words that anchor a sentence) are masked early in the forward process, limiting contextual information for accurate reconstruction. To address this, we introduce the Anchored Diffusion Language Model (ADLM), a novel two-stage framework that first predicts distributions over important tokens via an anchor network, and then predicts the likelihoods of missing tokens conditioned on the anchored predictions. ADLM significantly improves test perplexity on LM1B and OpenWebText, achieving up to 25.4% gains over prior DLMs, and narrows the gap with strong AR baselines. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot generalization across seven benchmarks and surpasses AR models in MAUVE score, which marks the first time a DLM generates better human-like text than an AR model. Theoretically, we derive an Anchored Negative Evidence Lower Bound (ANELBO) objective and show that anchoring improves sample complexity and likelihood modeling. Beyond diffusion, anchoring boosts performance in AR models and enhances reasoning in math and logic tasks, outperforming existing chain-of-thought approaches</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advances in markerless motion capture are expanding access to biomechanical movement analysis, making it feasible to obtain high-quality movement data from outpatient clinics, inpatient hospitals, therapy, and even home. Expanding access to movement data in these diverse contexts makes the challenge of performing downstream analytics all the more acute. Creating separate bespoke analysis code for all the tasks end users might want is both intractable and does not take advantage of the common features of human movement underlying them all. Recent studies have shown that fine-tuning language models to accept tokenized movement as an additional modality enables successful descriptive captioning of movement. Here, we explore whether such a multimodal motion-language model can answer detailed, clinically meaningful questions about movement. We collected over 30 hours of biomechanics from nearly 500 participants, many with movement impairments from a variety of etiologies, performing a range of movements used in clinical outcomes assessments. After tokenizing these movement trajectories, we created a multimodal dataset of motion-related questions and answers spanning a range of tasks. We developed BiomechGPT, a multimodal biomechanics-language model, on this dataset. Our results show that BiomechGPT demonstrates high performance across a range of tasks such as activity recognition, identifying movement impairments, diagnosis, scoring clinical outcomes, and measuring walking. BiomechGPT provides an important step towards a foundation model for rehabilitation movement data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) often overlook intersectional and culturally specific biases, particularly in underrepresented multilingual regions like South Asia. This work addresses these gaps by conducting a multilingual and intersectional analysis of LLM outputs across 10 Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages, identifying how cultural stigmas influenced by purdah and patriarchy are reinforced in generative tasks. We construct a culturally grounded bias lexicon capturing previously unexplored intersectional dimensions including gender, religion, marital status, and number of children. We use our lexicon to quantify intersectional bias and the effectiveness of self-debiasing in open-ended generations (e.g., storytelling, hobbies, and to-do lists), where bias manifests subtly and remains largely unexamined in multilingual contexts. Finally, we evaluate two self-debiasing strategies (simple and complex prompts) to measure their effectiveness in reducing culturally specific bias in Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages. Our approach offers a nuanced lens into cultural bias by introducing a novel bias lexicon and evaluation framework that extends beyond Eurocentric or small-scale multilingual settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Face restoration has achieved remarkable advancements through the years of development. However, ensuring that restored facial images exhibit high fidelity, preserve authentic features, and avoid introducing artifacts or biases remains a significant challenge. This highlights the need for models that are more "honest" in their reconstruction from low-quality inputs, accurately reflecting original characteristics. In this work, we propose HonestFace, a novel approach designed to restore faces with a strong emphasis on such honesty, particularly concerning identity consistency and texture realism. To achieve this, HonestFace incorporates several key components. First, we propose an identity embedder to effectively capture and preserve crucial identity features from both the low-quality input and multiple reference faces. Second, a masked face alignment method is presented to enhance fine-grained details and textural authenticity, thereby preventing the generation of patterned or overly synthetic textures and improving overall clarity. Furthermore, we present a new landmark-based evaluation metric. Based on affine transformation principles, this metric improves the accuracy compared to conventional L2 distance calculations for facial feature alignment. Leveraging these contributions within a one-step diffusion model framework, HonestFace delivers exceptional restoration results in terms of facial fidelity and realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both visual quality and quantitative assessments.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study aims to investigate the challenge of insufficient three-dimensional context in synthetic datasets for scene text rendering. Although recent advances in diffusion models and related techniques have improved certain aspects of scene text generation, most existing approaches continue to rely on 2D data, sourcing authentic training examples from movie posters and book covers, which limits their ability to capture the complex interactions among spatial layout and visual effects in real-world scenes. In particular, traditional 2D datasets do not provide the necessary geometric cues for accurately embedding text into diverse backgrounds. To address this limitation, we propose a novel standard for constructing synthetic datasets that incorporates surface normals to enrich three-dimensional scene characteristic. By adding surface normals to conventional 2D data, our approach aims to enhance the representation of spatial relationships and provide a more robust foundation for future scene text rendering methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that datasets built under this new standard offer improved geometric context, facilitating further advancements in text rendering under complex 3D-spatial conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Numerous recent prompt optimization approaches like chain-of-thought, have been demonstrated to significantly improve the quality of content generated by large language models (LLMs). In-context learning (ICL), a recent paradigm where a few representative examples guide content generation has also led to strong improvements in generation quality of LLM generated content. This idea has been applied to great effect in synthetic tabular data generation, where LLMs, through effective use of ICL and prompt optimization, can generate data that approximate samples from complex, heterogeneous distributions based on representative examples. However, ensuring high-fidelity synthetic data often requires a very large number of ICL examples which may be unavailable or costly to obtain. At the same time, as LLMs get larger and larger, their in-built prior knowledge becomes vast and can potentially substitute for specific data examples. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge-Guided Prompting (KGP) as a new knob in prompt optimization and explore the ability of KGP-based prompt optimization to offset the cost of ICL. Specifically, we explore the question `how many examples can a prompt substitute for?' and explore knowledge-guided prompting (KGP) where domain knowledge, either inferred or available, is explicitly injected into the prompt, reducing dependence on ICL examples. Our experiments systematically explore the trade-off between ICL and KGP, revealing an empirical scaling law that quantifies how quality of generated synthetic data varies with increasing domain knowledge and decreasing example count. Our results demonstrate that knowledge-guided prompting can be a scalable alternative, or addition, to in-context examples, unlocking new approaches to synthetic data generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) facilitates the fine-tuning of Foundation Models (FMs) using distributed data sources, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) gaining popularity due to its low communication costs and strong performance. While recent work acknowledges the benefits of heterogeneous LoRA in FL and introduces flexible algorithms to support its implementation, our theoretical analysis reveals a critical gap: existing methods lack formal convergence guarantees due to parameter truncation and biased gradient updates. Specifically, adapting client-specific LoRA ranks necessitates truncating global parameters, which introduces inherent truncation errors and leads to subsequent inaccurate gradient updates that accumulate over training rounds, ultimately degrading performance. To address the above issues, we propose \textbf{FedHL}, a simple yet effective \textbf{Fed}erated Learning framework tailored for \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{L}oRA. By leveraging the full-rank global model as a calibrated aggregation basis, FedHL eliminates the direct truncation bias from initial alignment with client-specific ranks. Furthermore, we derive the theoretically optimal aggregation weights by minimizing the gradient drift term in the convergence upper bound. Our analysis shows that FedHL guarantees $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate, and experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate a 1-3\% improvement over several state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Masked diffusion models (MDM) are powerful generative models for discrete data that generate samples by progressively unmasking tokens in a sequence. Each token can take one of two states: masked or unmasked. We observe that token sequences often remain unchanged between consecutive sampling steps; consequently, the model repeatedly processes identical inputs, leading to redundant computation. To address this inefficiency, we propose the Partial masking scheme (Prime), which augments MDM by allowing tokens to take intermediate states interpolated between the masked and unmasked states. This design enables the model to make predictions based on partially observed token information, and facilitates a fine-grained denoising process. We derive a variational training objective and introduce a simple architectural design to accommodate intermediate-state inputs. Our method demonstrates superior performance across a diverse set of generative modeling tasks. On text data, it achieves a perplexity of 15.36 on OpenWebText, outperforming previous MDM (21.52), autoregressive models (17.54), and their hybrid variants (17.58), without relying on an autoregressive formulation. On image data, it attains competitive FID scores of 3.26 on CIFAR-10 and 6.98 on ImageNet-32, comparable to leading continuous generative models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress, their proficiency in graph-related tasks remains notably limited, hindering the development of truly general-purpose models. Previous attempts, including pretraining graph foundation models or employing supervised fine-tuning, often face challenges such as the scarcity of large-scale, universally represented graph data. We introduce G1, a simple yet effective approach demonstrating that Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic graph-theoretic tasks can significantly scale LLMs' graph reasoning abilities. To enable RL training, we curate Erdõs, the largest graph reasoning dataset to date comprising 50 diverse graph-theoretic tasks of varying difficulty levels, 100k training data and 5k test data, all drived from real-world graphs. With RL on Erdõs, G1 obtains substantial improvements in graph reasoning, where our finetuned 3B model even outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (24x size). RL-trained models also show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The substantial training cost of diffusion models hinders their deployment. Immiscible Diffusion recently showed that reducing diffusion trajectory mixing in the noise space via linear assignment accelerates training by simplifying denoising. To extend immiscible diffusion beyond the inefficient linear assignment under high batch sizes and high dimensions, we refine this concept to a broader miscibility reduction at any layer and by any implementation. Specifically, we empirically demonstrate the bijective nature of the denoising process with respect to immiscible diffusion, ensuring its preservation of generative diversity. Moreover, we provide thorough analysis and show step-by-step how immiscibility eases denoising and improves efficiency. Extending beyond linear assignment, we propose a family of implementations including K-nearest neighbor (KNN) noise selection and image scaling to reduce miscibility, achieving up to >4x faster training across diverse models and tasks including unconditional/conditional generation, image editing, and robotics planning. Furthermore, our analysis of immiscibility offers a novel perspective on how optimal transport (OT) enhances diffusion training. By identifying trajectory miscibility as a fundamental bottleneck, we believe this work establishes a potentially new direction for future research into high-efficiency diffusion training.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Our examination of existing deep generative models (DGMs), including VAEs and GANs, reveals two problems. First, their capability in handling discrete observations and latent codes is unsatisfactory, though there are interesting efforts. Second, both VAEs and GANs optimize some criteria that are indirectly related to the data likelihood. To address these problems, we formally present Joint-stochastic-approximation (JSA) autoencoders - a new family of algorithms for building deep directed generative models, with application to semi-supervised learning. The JSA learning algorithm directly maximizes the data log-likelihood and simultaneously minimizes the inclusive KL divergence the between the posteriori and the inference model. We provide theoretical results and conduct a series of experiments to show its superiority such as being robust to structure mismatch between encoder and decoder, consistent handling of both discrete and continuous variables. Particularly we empirically show that JSA autoencoders with discrete latent space achieve comparable performance to other state-of-the-art DGMs with continuous latent space in semi-supervised tasks over the widely adopted datasets - MNIST and SVHN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that discrete latent variable models are successfully applied in the challenging semi-supervised tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To capture individual gait patterns, excluding identity-irrelevant cues in walking videos, such as clothing texture and color, remains a persistent challenge for vision-based gait recognition. Traditional silhouette- and pose-based methods, though theoretically effective at removing such distractions, often fall short of high accuracy due to their sparse and less informative inputs. Emerging end-to-end methods address this by directly denoising RGB videos using human priors. Building on this trend, we propose DenoisingGait, a novel gait denoising method. Inspired by the philosophy that "what I cannot create, I do not understand", we turn to generative diffusion models, uncovering how they partially filter out irrelevant factors for gait understanding. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-driven Feature Matching module, which, combined with background removal via human silhouettes, condenses the multi-channel diffusion features at each foreground pixel into a two-channel direction vector. Specifically, the proposed within- and cross-frame matching respectively capture the local vectorized structures of gait appearance and motion, producing a novel flow-like gait representation termed Gait Feature Field, which further reduces residual noise in diffusion features. Experiments on the CCPG, CASIA-B*, and SUSTech1K datasets demonstrate that DenoisingGait achieves a new SoTA performance in most cases for both within- and cross-domain evaluations.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pre-trained stable diffusion models (SD) have shown great advances in visual correspondence. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for accurate dense correspondence. Distinct from SD, DiTs exhibit a critical phenomenon in which very few feature activations exhibit significantly larger values than others, known as \textit{massive activations}, leading to uninformative representations and significant performance degradation for DiTs. The massive activations consistently concentrate at very few fixed dimensions across all image patch tokens, holding little local information. We trace these dimension-concentrated massive activations and find that such concentration can be effectively localized by the zero-initialized Adaptive Layer Norm (AdaLN-zero). Building on these findings, we propose Diffusion Transformer Feature (DiTF), a training-free framework designed to extract semantic-discriminative features from DiTs. Specifically, DiTF employs AdaLN to adaptively localize and normalize massive activations with channel-wise modulation. In addition, we develop a channel discard strategy to further eliminate the negative impacts from massive activations. Experimental results demonstrate that our DiTF outperforms both DINO and SD-based models and establishes a new state-of-the-art performance for DiTs in different visual correspondence tasks (\eg, with +9.4\% on Spair-71k and +4.4\% on AP-10K-C.S.).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-language retrieval (VLR) has attracted significant attention in both academia and industry, which involves using text (or images) as queries to retrieve corresponding images (or text). However, existing methods often neglect the rich visual semantics knowledge of entities, thus leading to incorrect retrieval results. To address this problem, we propose the Entity Visual Description enhanced CLIP (EvdCLIP), designed to leverage the visual knowledge of entities to enrich queries. Specifically, since humans recognize entities through visual cues, we employ a large language model (LLM) to generate Entity Visual Descriptions (EVDs) as alignment cues to complement textual data. These EVDs are then integrated into raw queries to create visually-rich, EVD-enhanced queries. Furthermore, recognizing that EVD-enhanced queries may introduce noise or low-quality expansions, we develop a novel, trainable EVD-aware Rewriter (EaRW) for vision-language retrieval tasks. EaRW utilizes EVD knowledge and the generative capabilities of the language model to effectively rewrite queries. With our specialized training strategy, EaRW can generate high-quality and low-noise EVD-enhanced queries. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on image-text retrieval benchmarks validate the superiority of EvdCLIP on vision-language retrieval tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern single-image super-resolution (SISR) models deliver photo-realistic results at the scale factors on which they are trained, but collapse when asked to magnify far beyond that regime. We address this scalability bottleneck with Chain-of-Zoom (CoZ), a model-agnostic framework that factorizes SISR into an autoregressive chain of intermediate scale-states with multi-scale-aware prompts. CoZ repeatedly re-uses a backbone SR model, decomposing the conditional probability into tractable sub-problems to achieve extreme resolutions without additional training. Because visual cues diminish at high magnifications, we augment each zoom step with multi-scale-aware text prompts generated by a vision-language model (VLM). The prompt extractor itself is fine-tuned using Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a critic VLM, aligning text guidance towards human preference. Experiments show that a standard 4x diffusion SR model wrapped in CoZ attains beyond 256x enlargement with high perceptual quality and fidelity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human-generated reward signals are critical for aligning generative models with human preferences, guiding both training and inference-time evaluations. While large language models (LLMs) employed as proxy evaluators, i.e., LLM-as-a-Judge, significantly reduce the costs associated with manual annotations, they typically require extensive modality-specific training data and fail to generalize well across diverse multimodal tasks. In this paper, we propose Flex-Judge, a reasoning-guided multimodal judge model that leverages minimal textual reasoning data to robustly generalize across multiple modalities and evaluation formats. Our core intuition is that structured textual reasoning explanations inherently encode generalizable decision-making patterns, enabling an effective transfer to multimodal judgments, e.g., with images or videos. Empirical results demonstrate that Flex-Judge, despite being trained on significantly fewer text data, achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art commercial APIs and extensively trained multimodal evaluators. Notably, Flex-Judge presents broad impact in modalities like molecule, where comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are scarce, underscoring its practical value in resource-constrained domains. Our framework highlights reasoning-based text supervision as a powerful, cost-effective alternative to traditional annotation-intensive approaches, substantially advancing scalable multimodal model-as-a-judge.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Causal attention has become a foundational mechanism in autoregressive vision-language models (VLMs), unifying textual and visual inputs under a single generative framework. However, existing causal mask-based strategies are inherited from large language models (LLMs) where they are tailored for text-only decoding, and their adaptation to vision tokens is insufficiently addressed in the prefill stage. Strictly masking future positions for vision queries introduces overly rigid constraints, which hinder the model's ability to leverage future context that often contains essential semantic cues for accurate inference. In this work, we empirically investigate how different causal masking strategies affect vision-language inference and then propose a family of future-aware attentions tailored for this setting. We first empirically analyze the effect of previewing future tokens for vision queries and demonstrate that rigid masking undermines the model's capacity to capture useful contextual semantic representations. Based on these findings, we propose a lightweight attention family that aggregates future visual context into past representations via pooling, effectively preserving the autoregressive structure while enhancing cross-token dependencies. We evaluate a range of causal masks across diverse vision-language inference settings and show that selectively compressing future semantic context into past representations benefits the inference.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize images of user-provided concepts in diverse contexts. Despite recent progress in multi-concept personalization, most are limited to object concepts and struggle to customize abstract concepts (e.g., pose, lighting). Some methods have begun exploring multi-concept personalization supporting abstract concepts, but they require test-time fine-tuning for each new concept, which is time-consuming and prone to overfitting on limited training images. In this work, we propose a novel tuning-free method for multi-concept personalization that can effectively customize both object and abstract concepts without test-time fine-tuning. Our method builds upon the modulation mechanism in pretrained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) model, leveraging the localized and semantically meaningful properties of the modulation space. Specifically, we propose a novel module, Mod-Adapter, to predict concept-specific modulation direction for the modulation process of concept-related text tokens. It incorporates vision-language cross-attention for extracting concept visual features, and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers that adaptively map the concept features into the modulation space. Furthermore, to mitigate the training difficulty caused by the large gap between the concept image space and the modulation space, we introduce a VLM-guided pretraining strategy that leverages the strong image understanding capabilities of vision-language models to provide semantic supervision signals. For a comprehensive comparison, we extend a standard benchmark by incorporating abstract concepts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-concept personalization, supported by quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations.</li>

The over 5K questions in our collection span a variety of scientific topics and include factual, application, and reasoning-based questions. We use our parallel dataset to test a number of Large Language Models (LLMs) and find a significant performance difference between the models in English and Dzongkha. We also look at different prompting strategies and discover that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting works well for reasoning questions but less well for factual ones. We also find that adding English translations enhances the precision of Dzongkha question responses. Our results point to exciting avenues for further study to improve LLM performance in Dzongkha and, more generally, in low-resource languages. We release the dataset at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely adopted for downstream fine-tuning of foundation models due to its efficiency and zero additional inference cost. Many real-world applications require foundation models to specialize in multiple tasks simultaneously, motivating the need for efficient multi-task adaptation. While recent approaches integrate LoRA with mixture-of-experts (MoE) to address this, the use of routers prevents parameter mergeability, which increases inference overhead and hinders unified multi-task adaptation, thereby limiting deployment practicality. In this work, we propose ThanoRA, a Task Heterogeneity-Aware Multi-Task Low-Rank Adaptation framework that enables multi-task adaptation while preserving the inference efficiency of LoRA. ThanoRA jointly models task heterogeneity and mitigates subspace interference throughout training. Specifically, motivated by inherent differences in complexity and heterogeneity across tasks, ThanoRA constructs task-specific LoRA subspaces at initialization, enabling fine-grained knowledge injection aligned with task heterogeneity. Furthermore, to prevent task interference and subspace collapse during multi-task training, ThanoRA introduces a subspace-preserving regularization that maintains the independence of task-specific representations. With the synergy of both components, ThanoRA enables efficient and unified multi-task adaptation. Extensive experiments across multimodal and text-only benchmarks under varying multi-task mixtures demonstrate that ThanoRA consistently achieves robust and superior performance over strong baselines without introducing additional inference overhead.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The simulation of N-body systems is a fundamental problem with applications in a wide range of fields, such as molecular dynamics, biochemistry, and pedestrian dynamics. Machine learning has become an invaluable tool for scaling physics-based simulators and developing models directly from experimental data. In particular, recent advances based on deep generative modeling and geometric deep learning have enabled probabilistic simulation by modeling complex distributions over trajectories while respecting the permutation symmetry that is fundamental to N-body systems. However, to generate realistic trajectories, existing methods must learn complex transformations starting from uninformed noise and do not allow for the exploitation of domain-informed priors. In this work, we propose STFlow to address this limitation. By leveraging flow matching and data-dependent couplings, STFlow facilitates physics-informed simulation of geometric trajectories without sacrificing model expressivity or scalability. Our evaluation on N-body dynamical systems, molecular dynamics, and pedestrian dynamics benchmarks shows that STFlow produces significantly lower prediction errors while enabling more efficient inference, highlighting the benefits of employing physics-informed prior distributions in probabilistic geometric trajectory modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Real-world driving requires people to observe the current environment, anticipate the future, and make appropriate driving decisions. This requirement is aligned well with the capabilities of world models, which understand the environment and predict the future. However, recent world models in autonomous driving are built explicitly, where they could predict the future by controllable driving video generation. We argue that driving world models should have two additional abilities: action control and action prediction. Following this line, previous methods are limited because they predict the video requires given actions of the same length as the video and ignore the dynamical action laws. To address these issues, we propose ProphetDWM, a novel end-to-end driving world model that jointly predicts future videos and actions. Our world model has an action module to learn latent action from the present to the future period by giving the action sequence and observations. And a diffusion-model-based transition module to learn the state distribution. The model is jointly trained by learning latent actions given finite states and predicting action and video. The joint learning connects the action dynamics and states and enables long-term future prediction. We evaluate our method in video generation and action prediction tasks on the Nuscenes dataset. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves the best video consistency and best action prediction accuracy, while also enabling high-quality long-term video and action generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Models such as Word2Vec and GloVe construct word embeddings based on the co-occurrence probability $P(i,j)$ of words $i$ and $j$ in text corpora. The resulting vectors $W_i$ not only group semantically similar words but also exhibit a striking linear analogy structure -- for example, $W_{\text{king}} - W_{\text{man}} + W_{\text{woman}} \approx W_{\text{queen}}$ -- whose theoretical origin remains unclear. Previous observations indicate that this analogy structure: (i) already emerges in the top eigenvectors of the matrix $M(i,j) = P(i,j)/P(i)P(j)$, (ii) strengthens and then saturates as more eigenvectors of $M (i, j)$, which controls the dimension of the embeddings, are included, (iii) is enhanced when using $\log M(i,j)$ rather than $M(i,j)$, and (iv) persists even when all word pairs involved in a specific analogy relation (e.g., king-queen, man-woman) are removed from the corpus. To explain these phenomena, we introduce a theoretical generative model in which words are defined by binary semantic attributes, and co-occurrence probabilities are derived from attribute-based interactions. This model analytically reproduces the emergence of linear analogy structure and naturally accounts for properties (i)-(iv). It can be viewed as giving fine-grained resolution into the role of each additional embedding dimension. It is robust to various forms of noise and agrees well with co-occurrence statistics measured on Wikipedia and the analogy benchmark introduced by Mikolov et al.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in AI-powered generative models have enabled the creation of increasingly realistic synthetic images, posing significant risks to information integrity and public trust on social media platforms. While robust detection frameworks and diverse, large-scale datasets are essential to mitigate these risks, existing academic efforts remain limited in scope: current datasets lack the diversity, scale, and realism required for social media contexts, while detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen generative technologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce So-Fake-Set, a comprehensive social media-oriented dataset with over 2 million high-quality images, diverse generative sources, and photorealistic imagery synthesized using 35 state-of-the-art generative models. To rigorously evaluate cross-domain robustness, we establish a novel and large-scale (100K) out-of-domain benchmark (So-Fake-OOD) featuring synthetic imagery from commercial models explicitly excluded from the training distribution, creating a realistic testbed for evaluating real-world performance. Leveraging these resources, we present So-Fake-R1, an advanced vision-language framework that employs reinforcement learning for highly accurate forgery detection, precise localization, and explainable inference through interpretable visual rationales. Extensive experiments show that So-Fake-R1 outperforms the second-best method, with a 1.3% gain in detection accuracy and a 4.5% increase in localization IoU. By integrating a scalable dataset, a challenging OOD benchmark, and an advanced detection framework, this work establishes a new foundation for social media-centric forgery detection research. The code, models, and datasets will be released publicly.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture for video generation, yet their computational and memory demands hinder practical deployment. While post-training quantization (PTQ) presents a promising approach to accelerate Video DiT models, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) dependence on lengthy, computation-heavy calibration procedures, and (2) considerable performance deterioration after quantization. To address these challenges, we propose DVD-Quant, a novel Data-free quantization framework for Video DiTs. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) Progressive Bounded Quantization (PBQ) and (2) Auto-scaling Rotated Quantization (ARQ) for calibration data-free quantization error reduction, as well as (3) $\delta$-Guided Bit Switching ($\delta$-GBS) for adaptive bit-width allocation. Extensive experiments across multiple video generation benchmarks demonstrate that DVD-Quant achieves an approximately 2$\times$ speedup over full-precision baselines on HunyuanVideo while maintaining visual fidelity. Notably, DVD-Quant is the first to enable W4A4 PTQ for Video DiTs without compromising video quality. Code and models will be available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce an encoder-only approach to learn the evolution operators of large-scale non-linear dynamical systems, such as those describing complex natural phenomena. Evolution operators are particularly well-suited for analyzing systems that exhibit complex spatio-temporal patterns and have become a key analytical tool across various scientific communities. As terabyte-scale weather datasets and simulation tools capable of running millions of molecular dynamics steps per day are becoming commodities, our approach provides an effective tool to make sense of them from a data-driven perspective. The core of it lies in a remarkable connection between self-supervised representation learning methods and the recently established learning theory of evolution operators. To show the usefulness of the proposed method, we test it across multiple scientific domains: explaining the folding dynamics of small proteins, the binding process of drug-like molecules in host sites, and autonomously finding patterns in climate data. Code and data to reproduce the experiments are made available open source.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Restoring real-world degraded images, such as old photographs or low-resolution images, presents a significant challenge due to the complex, mixed degradations they exhibit, such as scratches, color fading, and noise. Recent data-driven approaches have struggled with two main challenges: achieving high-fidelity restoration and providing object-level control over colorization. While diffusion models have shown promise in generating high-quality images with specific controls, they often fail to fully preserve image details during restoration. In this work, we propose an internal detail-preserving diffusion model for high-fidelity restoration of real-world degraded images. Our method utilizes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model as a generative prior, eliminating the need to train a model from scratch. Central to our approach is the Internal Image Detail Enhancement (IIDE) technique, which directs the diffusion model to preserve essential structural and textural information while mitigating degradation effects. The process starts by mapping the input image into a latent space, where we inject the diffusion denoising process with degradation operations that simulate the effects of various degradation factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in both qualitative assessments and perceptual quantitative evaluations. Additionally, our approach supports text-guided restoration, enabling object-level colorization control that mimics the expertise of professional photo editing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Infodemics and health misinformation have significant negative impact on individuals and society, exacerbating confusion and increasing hesitancy in adopting recommended health measures. Recent advancements in generative AI, capable of producing realistic, human like text and images, have significantly accelerated the spread and expanded the reach of health misinformation, resulting in an alarming surge in its dissemination. To combat the infodemics, most existing work has focused on developing misinformation datasets from social media and fact checking platforms, but has faced limitations in topical coverage, inclusion of AI generation, and accessibility of raw content. To address these issues, we present MM Health, a large scale multimodal misinformation dataset in the health domain consisting of 34,746 news article encompassing both textual and visual information. MM Health includes human-generated multimodal information (5,776 articles) and AI generated multimodal information (28,880 articles) from various SOTA generative AI models. Additionally, We benchmarked our dataset against three tasks (reliability checks, originality checks, and fine-grained AI detection) demonstrating that existing SOTA models struggle to accurately distinguish the reliability and origin of information. Our dataset aims to support the development of misinformation detection across various health scenarios, facilitating the detection of human and machine generated content at multimodal levels.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces the Unified Opinion Concepts (UOC) ontology to integrate opinions within their semantic context. The UOC ontology bridges the gap between the semantic representation of opinion across different formulations. It is a unified conceptualisation based on the facets of opinions studied extensively in NLP and semantic structures described through symbolic descriptions. We further propose the Unified Opinion Concept Extraction (UOCE) task of extracting opinions from the text with enhanced expressivity. Additionally, we provide a manually extended and re-annotated evaluation dataset for this task and tailored evaluation metrics to assess the adherence of extracted opinions to UOC semantics. Finally, we establish baseline performance for the UOCE task using state-of-the-art generative models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation models and their checkpoints have significantly advanced deep learning, boosting performance across various applications. However, fine-tuned models often struggle outside their specific domains and exhibit considerable redundancy. Recent studies suggest that combining a pruned fine-tuned model with the original pre-trained model can mitigate forgetting, reduce interference when merging model parameters across tasks, and improve compression efficiency. In this context, developing an effective pruning strategy for fine-tuned models is crucial. Leveraging the advantages of the task vector mechanism, we preprocess fine-tuned models by calculating the differences between them and the original model. Recognizing that different task vector subspaces contribute variably to model performance, we introduce a novel method called Neural Parameter Search (NPS-Pruning) for slimming down fine-tuned models. This method enhances pruning efficiency by searching through neural parameters of task vectors within low-rank subspaces. Our method has three key applications: enhancing knowledge transfer through pairwise model interpolation, facilitating effective knowledge fusion via model merging, and enabling the deployment of compressed models that retain near-original performance while significantly reducing storage costs. Extensive experiments across vision, NLP, and multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, resulting in substantial performance gains.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reward-driven proactive dialogue agents require precise estimation of user satisfaction as an intrinsic reward signal to determine optimal interaction strategies. Specifically, this framework triggers clarification questions when detecting potential user dissatisfaction during interactions in the industrial dialogue system. Traditional works typically rely on training a neural network model based on weak labels which are generated by a simple model trained on user actions after current turn. However, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations in real-world scenarios: (1) Noisy Reward Supervision, dependence on weak labels derived from post-hoc user actions introduces bias, particularly failing to capture satisfaction signals in ASR-error-induced utterances; (2) Long-Tail Feedback Sparsity, the power-law distribution of user queries causes reward prediction accuracy to drop in low-frequency domains. The noise in the weak labels and a power-law distribution of user utterances results in that the model is hard to learn good representation of user utterances and sessions. To address these limitations, we propose two auxiliary tasks to improve the representation learning of user utterances and sessions that enhance user satisfaction prediction. The first one is a contrastive self-supervised learning task, which helps the model learn the representation of rare user utterances and identify ASR errors. The second one is a domain-intent classification task, which aids the model in learning the representation of user sessions from long-tailed domains and improving the model's performance on such domains. The proposed method is evaluated on DuerOS, demonstrating significant improvements in the accuracy of error recognition on rare user utterances and long-tailed domains.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present MADCAT, a self-supervised approach designed to address the concept drift problem in malware detection. MADCAT employs an encoder-decoder architecture and works by test-time training of the encoder on a small, balanced subset of the test-time data using a self-supervised objective. During test-time training, the model learns features that are useful for detecting both previously seen (old) data and newly arriving samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MADCAT in continuous Android malware detection settings. MADCAT consistently outperforms baseline methods in detection performance at test time. We also show the synergy between MADCAT and prior approaches in addressing concept drift in malware detection</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences has emerged as a critical research challenge. While recent advances in this area have extended preference optimization techniques from large language models (LLMs) to the diffusion setting, they often struggle with limited exploration. In this work, we propose a novel and orthogonal approach to enhancing diffusion-based preference optimization. First, we introduce a stable reference model update strategy that relaxes the frozen reference model, encouraging exploration while maintaining a stable optimization anchor through reference model regularization. Second, we present a timestep-aware training strategy that mitigates the reward scale imbalance problem across timesteps. Our method can be integrated into various preference optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that our approach improves the performance of state-of-the-art methods on human preference evaluation benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The unusual properties of in-context learning (ICL) have prompted investigations into the internal mechanisms of large language models. Prior work typically focuses on either special attention heads or task vectors at specific layers, but lacks a unified framework linking these components to the evolution of hidden states across layers that ultimately produce the model's output. In this paper, we propose such a framework for ICL in classification tasks by analyzing two geometric factors that govern performance: the separability and alignment of query hidden states. A fine-grained analysis of layer-wise dynamics reveals a striking two-stage mechanism: separability emerges in early layers, while alignment develops in later layers. Ablation studies further show that Previous Token Heads drive separability, while Induction Heads and task vectors enhance alignment. Our findings thus bridge the gap between attention heads and task vectors, offering a unified account of ICL's underlying mechanisms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated the powerful exploration capabilities and multimodality of generative diffusion-based policies. While substantial progress has been made in offline RL and off-policy RL settings, integrating diffusion policies into on-policy frameworks like PPO remains underexplored. This gap is particularly significant given the widespread use of large-scale parallel GPU-accelerated simulators, such as IsaacLab, which are optimized for on-policy RL algorithms and enable rapid training of complex robotic tasks. A key challenge lies in computing state-action log-likelihoods under diffusion policies, which is straightforward for Gaussian policies but intractable for flow-based models due to irreversible forward-reverse processes and discretization errors (e.g., Euler-Maruyama approximations). To bridge this gap, we propose GenPO, a generative policy optimization framework that leverages exact diffusion inversion to construct invertible action mappings. GenPO introduces a novel doubled dummy action mechanism that enables invertibility via alternating updates, resolving log-likelihood computation barriers. Furthermore, we also use the action log-likelihood for unbiased entropy and KL divergence estimation, enabling KL-adaptive learning rates and entropy regularization in on-policy updates. Extensive experiments on eight IsaacLab benchmarks, including legged locomotion (Ant, Humanoid, Anymal-D, Unitree H1, Go2), dexterous manipulation (Shadow Hand), aerial control (Quadcopter), and robotic arm tasks (Franka), demonstrate GenPO's superiority over existing RL baselines. Notably, GenPO is the first method to successfully integrate diffusion policies into on-policy RL, unlocking their potential for large-scale parallelized training and real-world robotic deployment.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We address the optimization problem of simultaneously minimizing multiple objective functionals over a family of probability distributions. This type of Multi-Objective Distributional Optimization commonly arises in machine learning and statistics, with applications in areas such as multiple target sampling, multi-task learning, and multi-objective generative modeling. To solve this problem, we propose an iterative particle-based algorithm, which we call Muliple Wasserstein Gradient Descent (MWGraD), which constructs a flow of intermediate empirical distributions, each being represented by a set of particles, which gradually minimize the multiple objective functionals simultaneously. Specifically, MWGraD consists of two key steps at each iteration. First, it estimates the Wasserstein gradient for each objective functional based on the current particles. Then, it aggregates these gradients into a single Wasserstein gradient using dynamically adjusted weights and updates the particles accordingly. In addition, we provide theoretical analysis and present experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of MWGraD.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have been widely used for style mimicry and personalized customization through methods such as DreamBooth and Textual Inversion. This has raised concerns about intellectual property protection and the generation of deceptive content. Recent studies, such as Glaze and Anti-DreamBooth, have proposed using adversarial noise to protect images from these attacks. However, recent purification-based methods, such as DiffPure and Noise Upscaling, have successfully attacked these latest defenses, showing the vulnerabilities of these methods. Moreover, present methods show limited transferability across models, making them less effective against unknown text-to-image models. To address these issues, we propose a novel anti-mimicry method, StyleGuard. We propose a novel style loss that optimizes the style-related features in the latent space to make it deviate from the original image, which improves model-agnostic transferability. Additionally, to enhance the perturbation's ability to bypass diffusion-based purification, we designed a novel upscale loss that involves ensemble purifiers and upscalers during training. Extensive experiments on the WikiArt and CelebA datasets demonstrate that StyleGuard outperforms existing methods in robustness against various transformations and purifications, effectively countering style mimicry in various models. Moreover, StyleGuard is effective on different style mimicry methods, including DreamBooth and Textual Inversion.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent breakthroughs in large multimodal models (LMMs), such as the impressive GPT-4o-Native, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in following general-purpose instructions for image generation. However, current benchmarks often lack the necessary breadth and depth to fully evaluate the diverse capabilities of these models. To overcome this limitation, we introduce OmniGenBench, a novel and comprehensive benchmark meticulously designed to assess the instruction-following abilities of state-of-the-art LMMs across both perception-centric and cognition-centric dimensions. Our OmniGenBench includes 57 diverse sub-tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, systematically categorized according to the specific model capabilities they demand.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video Diffusion Transformers (VDiTs) have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality video generation, but remain computationally expensive due to the quadratic complexity of attention over high-dimensional video sequences. Recent attention acceleration methods leverage the sparsity of attention patterns to improve efficiency; however, they often overlook inefficiencies of redundant long-range interactions. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{VORTA}, an acceleration framework with two novel components: 1) a sparse attention mechanism that efficiently captures long-range dependencies, and 2) a routing strategy that adaptively replaces full 3D attention with specialized sparse attention variants throughout the sampling process. It achieves a $1.76\times$ end-to-end speedup without quality loss on VBench. Furthermore, VORTA can seamlessly integrate with various other acceleration methods, such as caching and step distillation, reaching up to $14.41\times$ speedup with negligible performance degradation. VORTA demonstrates its efficiency and enhances the practicality of VDiTs in real-world settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-language models like CLIP can offer a promising foundation for 3D scene understanding when extended with 3D tokenizers. However, standard approaches, such as k-nearest neighbor or radius-based tokenization, struggle with cross-domain generalization due to sensitivity to dataset-specific spatial scales. We present a universal 3D tokenizer designed for scale-invariant representation learning with a frozen CLIP backbone. We show that combining superpoint-based grouping with coordinate scale normalization consistently outperforms conventional methods through extensive experimental analysis. Specifically, we introduce S4Token, a tokenization pipeline that produces semantically-informed tokens regardless of scene scale. Our tokenizer is trained without annotations using masked point modeling and clustering-based objectives, along with cross-modal distillation to align 3D tokens with 2D multi-view image features. For dense prediction tasks, we propose a superpoint-level feature propagation module to recover point-level detail from sparse tokens.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Building on the framework proposed in Boffi et al. (2024), we present a systematic approach for learning flow maps associated with flow and diffusion models. Flow map-based models, commonly known as consistency models, encompass recent efforts to improve the efficiency of generative models based on solutions to differential equations. By exploiting a relationship between the velocity field underlying a continuous-time flow and the instantaneous rate of change of the flow map, we show how to convert existing distillation schemes into direct training algorithms via self-distillation, eliminating the need for pre-trained models. We empirically evaluate several instantiations of our framework, finding that high-dimensional tasks like image synthesis benefit from objective functions that avoid temporal and spatial derivatives of the flow map, while lower-dimensional tasks can benefit from objectives incorporating higher-order derivatives to capture sharp features.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding how knowledge is distributed across the layers of generative models is crucial for improving interpretability, controllability, and adaptation. While prior work has explored knowledge localization in UNet-based architectures, Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based models remain underexplored in this context. In this paper, we propose a model- and knowledge-agnostic method to localize where specific types of knowledge are encoded within the DiT blocks. We evaluate our method on state-of-the-art DiT-based models, including PixArt-alpha, FLUX, and SANA, across six diverse knowledge categories. We show that the identified blocks are both interpretable and causally linked to the expression of knowledge in generated outputs. Building on these insights, we apply our localization framework to two key applications: model personalization and knowledge unlearning. In both settings, our localized fine-tuning approach enables efficient and targeted updates, reducing computational cost, improving task-specific performance, and better preserving general model behavior with minimal interference to unrelated or surrounding content. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the internal structure of DiTs and introduce a practical pathway for more interpretable, efficient, and controllable model editing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generating images, audio, and video, but their adaptation to text remains challenging due to its discrete nature. Prior approaches either apply Gaussian diffusion in continuous latent spaces, which inherits semantic structure but struggles with token decoding, or operate in categorical simplex space, which respect discreteness but disregard semantic relation between tokens. In this paper, we propose Smoothing Diffusion on Token Embeddings (Smoothie), a novel diffusion method that combines the strengths of both approaches by progressively smoothing token embeddings based on semantic similarity. This technique enables gradual information removal while maintaining a natural decoding process. Experimental results on several sequence-to-sequence generation tasks demonstrate that Smoothie outperforms existing diffusion-based models in generation quality. Furthermore, ablation studies show that our proposed diffusion space yields better performance than both the standard embedding space and the categorical simplex.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are essential for video generation but suffer from significant latency due to the quadratic complexity of attention. By computing only critical tokens, sparse attention reduces computational costs and offers a promising acceleration approach. However, we identify that existing methods fail to approach optimal generation quality under the same computation budget for two reasons: (1) Inaccurate critical token identification: current methods cluster tokens based on position rather than semantics, leading to imprecise aggregated representations. (2) Excessive computation waste: critical tokens are scattered among non-critical ones, leading to wasted computation on GPUs, which are optimized for processing contiguous tokens. In this paper, we propose SVG2, a training-free framework that maximizes identification accuracy and minimizes computation waste, achieving a Pareto frontier trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. The core of SVG2 is semantic-aware permutation, which clusters and reorders tokens based on semantic similarity using k-means. This approach ensures both a precise cluster representation, improving identification accuracy, and a densified layout of critical tokens, enabling efficient computation without padding. Additionally, SVG2 integrates top-p dynamic budget control and customized kernel implementations, achieving up to 2.30x and 1.89x speedup while maintaining a PSNR of up to 30 and 26 on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present the Semantics-aware Dataset and Benchmark Generation Pipeline for Open-vocabulary Object Navigation in Dynamic Scenes (SD-OVON). It utilizes pretraining multimodal foundation models to generate infinite unique photo-realistic scene variants that adhere to real-world semantics and daily commonsense for the training and the evaluation of navigation agents, accompanied with a plugin for generating object navigation task episodes compatible to the Habitat simulator. In addition, we offer two pre-generated object navigation task datasets, SD-OVON-3k and SD-OVON-10k, comprising respectively about 3k and 10k episodes of the open-vocabulary object navigation task, derived from the SD-OVON-Scenes dataset with 2.5k photo-realistic scans of real-world environments and the SD-OVON-Objects dataset with 0.9k manually inspected scanned and artist-created manipulatable object models. Unlike prior datasets limited to static environments, SD-OVON covers dynamic scenes and manipulatable objects, facilitating both real-to-sim and sim-to-real robotic applications. This approach enhances the realism of navigation tasks, the training and the evaluation of open-vocabulary object navigation agents in complex settings. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and datasets, we propose two baselines and evaluate them along with state-of-the-art baselines on SD-OVON-3k. The datasets, benchmark and source code are publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce ``Partition Generative Models'' (PGMs), a novel approach to masked generative modeling (MGMs), particularly effective for masked diffusion language modeling (MDLMs). PGM divides tokens into two distinct groups and employs sparse attention patterns to prevent cross-group information exchange. Hence, the model is trained to predict tokens in one group based solely on information from the other group. This partitioning strategy eliminates the need for MASK tokens entirely. While traditional MGMs inefficiently process MASK tokens during generation, PGMs achieve greater computational efficiency by operating exclusively on unmasked tokens. Our experiments on OpenWebText with a context length of 1024 tokens demonstrate that PGMs deliver at least 5x improvements in both latency and throughput compared to MDLM when using the same number of sampling steps, while generating samples with better generative perplexity than MDLM. Finally, we show that PGMs can be distilled with Self-Distillation Through Time (SDTT), a method originally devised for MDLM, in order to achieve further inference gains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of generative AI models has provided users with numerous options to address their prompts. When selecting a generative AI model for a given prompt, users should consider not only the performance of the chosen model but also its associated service cost. The principle guiding such consideration is to select the least expensive model among the available satisfactory options. However, existing model-selection approaches typically prioritize performance, overlooking pricing differences between models. In this paper, we introduce PromptWise, an online learning framework designed to assign a sequence of prompts to a group of large language models (LLMs) in a cost-effective manner. PromptWise strategically queries cheaper models first, progressing to more expensive options only if the lower-cost models fail to adequately address a given prompt. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate PromptWise's effectiveness across various tasks, including puzzles of varying complexity and code generation/translation tasks. The results highlight that PromptWise consistently outperforms cost-unaware baseline methods, emphasizing that directly assigning prompts to the most expensive models can lead to higher costs and potentially lower average performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Operator learning seeks to approximate mappings from input functions to output solutions, particularly in the context of partial differential equations (PDEs). While recent advances such as DeepONet and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) have demonstrated strong performance, they often rely on regular grid discretizations, limiting their applicability to complex or irregular domains. In this work, we propose a Graph-based Operator Learning with Attention (GOLA) framework that addresses this limitation by constructing graphs from irregularly sampled spatial points and leveraging attention-enhanced Graph Neural Netwoks (GNNs) to model spatial dependencies with global information. To improve the expressive capacity, we introduce a Fourier-based encoder that projects input functions into a frequency space using learnable complex coefficients, allowing for flexible embeddings even with sparse or nonuniform samples. We evaluated our approach across a range of 2D PDEs, including Darcy Flow, Advection, Eikonal, and Nonlinear Diffusion, under varying sampling densities. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, particularly in data-scarce regimes, demonstrating strong generalization and efficiency on irregular domains.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Document alignment and registration play a crucial role in numerous real-world applications, such as automated form processing, anomaly detection, and workflow automation. Traditional methods for document alignment rely on image-based features like keypoints, edges, and textures to estimate geometric transformations, such as homographies. However, these approaches often require access to the original document images, which may not always be available due to privacy, storage, or transmission constraints. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) outputs as features for homography estimation. By utilizing the spatial positions and textual content of OCR-detected words, our method enables document alignment without relying on pixel-level image data. This technique is particularly valuable in scenarios where only OCR outputs are accessible. Furthermore, the method is robust to OCR noise, incorporating RANSAC to handle outliers and inaccuracies in the OCR data. On a set of test documents, we demonstrate that our OCR-based approach even performs more accurately than traditional image-based methods, offering a more efficient and scalable solution for document registration tasks. The proposed method facilitates applications in document processing, all while reducing reliance on high-dimensional image data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a neural physics system for real-time, interactive fluid simulations. Traditional physics-based methods, while accurate, are computationally intensive and suffer from latency issues. Recent machine-learning methods reduce computational costs while preserving fidelity; yet most still fail to satisfy the latency constraints for real-time use and lack support for interactive applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel hybrid method that integrates numerical simulation, neural physics, and generative control. Our neural physics jointly pursues low-latency simulation and high physical fidelity by employing a fallback safeguard to classical numerical solvers. Furthermore, we develop a diffusion-based controller that is trained using a reverse modeling strategy to generate external dynamic force fields for fluid manipulation. Our system demonstrates robust performance across diverse 2D/3D scenarios, material types, and obstacle interactions, achieving real-time simulations at high frame rates (11~29% latency) while enabling fluid control guided by user-friendly freehand sketches. We present a significant step towards practical, controllable, and physically plausible fluid simulations for real-time interactive applications. We promise to release both models and data upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Early identification of weeds is essential for effective management and control, and there is growing interest in automating the process using computer vision techniques coupled with AI methods. However, challenges associated with training AI-based weed identification models, such as limited expert-verified data and complexity and variability in morphological features, have hindered progress. To address these issues, we present WeedNet, the first global-scale weed identification model capable of recognizing an extensive set of weed species, including noxious and invasive plant species. WeedNet is an end-to-end real-time weed identification pipeline and uses self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, and enhanced trustworthiness strategies. WeedNet achieved 91.02% accuracy across 1,593 weed species, with 41% species achieving 100% accuracy. Using a fine-tuning strategy and a Global-to-Local approach, the local Iowa WeedNet model achieved an overall accuracy of 97.38% for 85 Iowa weeds, most classes exceeded a 90% mean accuracy per class. Testing across intra-species dissimilarity (developmental stages) and inter-species similarity (look-alike species) suggests that diversity in the images collected, spanning all the growth stages and distinguishable plant characteristics, is crucial in driving model performance. The generalizability and adaptability of the Global WeedNet model enable it to function as a foundational model, with the Global-to-Local strategy allowing fine-tuning for region-specific weed communities. Additional validation of drone- and ground-rover-based images highlights the potential of WeedNet for integration into robotic platforms. Furthermore, integration with AI for conversational use provides intelligent agricultural and ecological conservation consulting tools for farmers, agronomists, researchers, land managers, and government agencies across diverse landscapes.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) in heterogeneous networks presents unique challenges due to node and edge heterogeneity. Existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods primarily focus on homogeneous GAD and thus fail to address three key issues: (C1) Capturing abnormal signal and rich semantics across diverse meta-paths; (C2) Retaining high-frequency content in HIN dimension alignment; and (C3) Learning effectively from difficult anomaly samples with class imbalance. To overcome these, we propose ChiGAD, a spectral GNN framework based on a novel Chi-Square filter, inspired by the wavelet effectiveness in diverse domains. Specifically, ChiGAD consists of: (1) Multi-Graph Chi-Square Filter, which captures anomalous information via applying dedicated Chi-Square filters to each meta-path graph; (2) Interactive Meta-Graph Convolution, which aligns features while preserving high-frequency information and incorporates heterogeneous messages by a unified Chi-Square Filter; and (3) Contribution-Informed Cross-Entropy Loss, which prioritizes difficult anomalies to address class imbalance. Extensive experiments on public and industrial datasets show that ChiGAD outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple metrics. Additionally, its homogeneous variant, ChiGNN, excels on seven GAD datasets, validating the effectiveness of Chi-Square filters. Our code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Understanding and synthesizing realistic 3D hand-object interactions (HOI) is critical for applications ranging from immersive AR/VR to dexterous robotics. Existing methods struggle with generalization, performing well on closed-set objects and predefined tasks but failing to handle unseen objects or open-vocabulary instructions. We introduce OpenHOI, the first framework for open-world HOI synthesis, capable of generating long-horizon manipulation sequences for novel objects guided by free-form language commands. Our approach integrates a 3D Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) fine-tuned for joint affordance grounding and semantic task decomposition, enabling precise localization of interaction regions (e.g., handles, buttons) and breakdown of complex instructions (e.g., "Find a water bottle and take a sip") into executable sub-tasks. To synthesize physically plausible interactions, we propose an affordance-driven diffusion model paired with a training-free physics refinement stage that minimizes penetration and optimizes affordance alignment. Evaluations across diverse scenarios demonstrate OpenHOI's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to novel object categories, multi-stage tasks, and complex language instructions.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most publicly available medical segmentation datasets are only partially labeled, with annotations provided for a subset of anatomical structures. When multiple datasets are combined for training, this incomplete annotation poses challenges, as it limits the model's ability to learn shared anatomical representations among datasets. Furthermore, vision-only frameworks often fail to capture complex anatomical relationships and task-specific distinctions, leading to reduced segmentation accuracy and poor generalizability to unseen datasets. In this study, we proposed a novel CLIP-DINO Prompt-Driven Segmentation Network (CDPDNet), which combined a self-supervised vision transformer with CLIP-based text embedding and introduced task-specific text prompts to tackle these challenges. Specifically, the framework was constructed upon a convolutional neural network (CNN) and incorporated DINOv2 to extract both fine-grained and global visual features, which were then fused using a multi-head cross-attention module to overcome the limited long-range modeling capability of CNNs. In addition, CLIP-derived text embeddings were projected into the visual space to help model complex relationships among organs and tumors. To further address the partial label challenge and enhance inter-task discriminative capability, a Text-based Task Prompt Generation (TTPG) module that generated task-specific prompts was designed to guide the segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple medical imaging datasets demonstrated that CDPDNet consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dataset distillation has emerged as an effective strategy, significantly reducing training costs and facilitating more efficient model deployment. Recent advances have leveraged generative models to distill datasets by capturing the underlying data distribution. Unfortunately, existing methods require model fine-tuning with distillation losses to encourage diversity and representativeness. However, these methods do not guarantee sample diversity, limiting their performance. We propose a mode-guided diffusion model leveraging a pre-trained diffusion model without the need to fine-tune with distillation losses. Our approach addresses dataset diversity in three stages: Mode Discovery to identify distinct data modes, Mode Guidance to enhance intra-class diversity, and Stop Guidance to mitigate artifacts in synthetic samples that affect performance. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy gains of 4.4%, 2.9%, 1.6%, and 1.6% on ImageNette, ImageIDC, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K, respectively. Our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning diffusion models with distillation losses, significantly reducing computational costs. Our code is available on the project webpage: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Protein design is a fundamental challenge in biotechnology, aiming to design novel sequences with specific functions within the vast space of possible proteins. Recent advances in deep generative models have enabled function-based protein design from textual descriptions, yet struggle with structural plausibility. Inspired by classical protein design methods that leverage natural protein structures, we explore whether incorporating fragments from natural proteins can enhance foldability in generative models. Our empirical results show that even random incorporation of fragments improves foldability. Building on this insight, we introduce ProDVa, a novel protein design approach that integrates a text encoder for functional descriptions, a protein language model for designing proteins, and a fragment encoder to dynamically retrieve protein fragments based on textual functional descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively designs protein sequences that are both functionally aligned and structurally plausible. Compared to state-of-the-art models, ProDVa achieves comparable function alignment using less than 0.04% of the training data, while designing significantly more well-folded proteins, with the proportion of proteins having pLDDT above 70 increasing by 7.38% and those with PAE below 10 increasing by 9.6%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image (T2I) generation models can inadvertently produce not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, prompting the integration of text and image safety filters. Recent advances employ large language models (LLMs) for semantic-level detection, rendering traditional token-level perturbation attacks largely ineffective. However, our evaluation shows that existing jailbreak methods are ineffective against these modern filters. We introduce GhostPrompt, the first automated jailbreak framework that combines dynamic prompt optimization with multimodal feedback. It consists of two key components: (i) Dynamic Optimization, an iterative process that guides a large language model (LLM) using feedback from text safety filters and CLIP similarity scores to generate semantically aligned adversarial prompts; and (ii) Adaptive Safety Indicator Injection, which formulates the injection of benign visual cues as a reinforcement learning problem to bypass image-level filters. GhostPrompt achieves state-of-the-art performance, increasing the ShieldLM-7B bypass rate from 12.5\% (Sneakyprompt) to 99.0\%, improving CLIP score from 0.2637 to 0.2762, and reducing the time cost by $4.2 \times$. Moreover, it generalizes to unseen filters including GPT-4.1 and successfully jailbreaks DALLE 3 to generate NSFW images in our evaluation, revealing systemic vulnerabilities in current multimodal defenses. To support further research on AI safety and red-teaming, we will release code and adversarial prompts under a controlled-access protocol.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image generation with their ability to synthesize realistic and diverse scenes, they continue to struggle to generate consistent and legible text within images. This shortcoming is commonly attributed to the locality bias inherent in diffusion-based generation, which limits their ability to model long-range spatial dependencies. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{STRICT}$, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test the ability of diffusion models to render coherent and instruction-aligned text in images. Our benchmark evaluates models across multiple dimensions: (1) the maximum length of readable text that can be generated; (2) the correctness and legibility of the generated text, and (3) the ratio of not following instructions for generating text. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models, including proprietary and open-source variants, and reveal persistent limitations in long-range consistency and instruction-following capabilities. Our findings provide insights into architectural bottlenecks and motivate future research directions in multimodal generative modeling.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pansharpening is a fundamental task in remote sensing that integrates high-resolution panchromatic imagery (PAN) with low-resolution multispectral imagery (LRMS) to produce an enhanced image with both high spatial and spectral resolution. Despite significant progress in deep learning-based approaches, existing methods often fail to capture the global priors inherent in remote sensing data distributions. Diffusion-based models have recently emerged as promising solutions due to their powerful distribution mapping capabilities; however, they suffer from significant inference latency, which limits their practical applicability. In this work, we propose the Kernel Space Diffusion Model (KSDiff), a novel approach that leverages diffusion processes in a latent space to generate convolutional kernels enriched with global contextual information, thereby improving pansharpening quality while enabling faster inference. Specifically, KSDiff constructs these kernels through the integration of a low-rank core tensor generator and a unified factor generator, orchestrated by a structure-aware multi-head attention mechanism. We further introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for pansharpening, enabling KSDiff to serve as a framework for enhancing existing pansharpening architectures. Experiments on three widely used datasets, including WorldView-3, GaoFen-2, and QuickBird, demonstrate the superior performance of KSDiff both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code will be released upon possible acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation protocols through comprehensive experimental analyses, revealing three critical limitations in current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation methods: first, we establish averaged AUC/AP metrics over multi-round annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks (UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives for future VAD model development.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities, existing methods for stylized image generation based on these models often require textual inversion or fine-tuning with style images, which is time-consuming and limits the practical applicability of large-scale diffusion models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel stylized image generation method leveraging a pre-trained large-scale diffusion model without requiring fine-tuning or any additional optimization, termed as OmniPainter. Specifically, we exploit the self-consistency property of latent consistency models to extract the representative style statistics from reference style images to guide the stylization process. Additionally, we then introduce the norm mixture of self-attention, which enables the model to query the most relevant style patterns from these statistics for the intermediate output content features. This mechanism also ensures that the stylized results align closely with the distribution of the reference style images. Our qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual generation and understanding are two deeply interconnected aspects of human intelligence, yet they have been traditionally treated as separate tasks in machine learning. In this paper, we propose Jodi, a diffusion framework that unifies visual generation and understanding by jointly modeling the image domain and multiple label domains. Specifically, Jodi is built upon a linear diffusion transformer along with a role switch mechanism, which enables it to perform three particular types of tasks: (1) joint generation, where the model simultaneously generates images and multiple labels; (2) controllable generation, where images are generated conditioned on any combination of labels; and (3) image perception, where multiple labels can be predicted at once from a given image. Furthermore, we present the Joint-1.6M dataset, which contains 200,000 high-quality images collected from public sources, automatic labels for 7 visual domains, and LLM-generated captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Jodi excels in both generation and understanding tasks and exhibits strong extensibility to a wider range of visual domains.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Masked generative models (MGMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for image synthesis, combining parallel decoding with strong bidirectional context modeling. However, generating high-quality samples typically requires many iterative decoding steps, resulting in high inference costs. A straightforward way to speed up generation is by decoding more tokens in each step, thereby reducing the total number of steps. However, when many tokens are decoded simultaneously, the model can only estimate the univariate marginal distributions independently, failing to capture the dependency among them. As a result, reducing the number of steps significantly compromises generation fidelity. In this work, we introduce ReCAP (Reused Context-Aware Prediction), a plug-and-play module that accelerates inference in MGMs by constructing low-cost steps via reusing feature embeddings from previously decoded context tokens. ReCAP interleaves standard full evaluations with lightweight steps that cache and reuse context features, substantially reducing computation while preserving the benefits of fine-grained, iterative generation. We demonstrate its effectiveness on top of three representative MGMs (MaskGIT, MAGE, and MAR), including both discrete and continuous token spaces and covering diverse architectural designs. In particular, on ImageNet256 class-conditional generation, ReCAP achieves up to 2.4x faster inference than the base model with minimal performance drop, and consistently delivers better efficiency-fidelity trade-offs under various generation settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in real-world applications. However, adapting LLMs to novel tasks via fine-tuning often requires substantial training data and computational resources that are impractical in few-shot scenarios. Existing approaches, such as in-context learning and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), face key limitations: in-context learning introduces additional inference computational overhead with limited performance gains, while PEFT models are prone to overfitting on the few demonstration examples. In this work, we reinterpret the forward pass of LLMs as an optimization process, a sequence of preconditioned gradient descent steps refining internal representations. Based on this connection, we propose Optimization-Inspired Few-Shot Adaptation (OFA), integrating a parameterization that learns preconditioners without introducing additional trainable parameters, and an objective that improves optimization efficiency by learning preconditioners based on a convergence bound, while simultaneously steering the optimization path toward the flat local minimum. Our method overcomes both issues of ICL-based and PEFT-based methods, and demonstrates superior performance over the existing methods on a variety of few-shot adaptation tasks in experiments.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) tractography offers detailed insights into the structural connectivity of the brain, but presents challenges in effective representation and interpretation in deep learning models. In this work, we propose a novel 2D representation of DTI tractography that encodes tract-level fractional anisotropy (FA) values into a 9x9 grayscale image. This representation is processed through a Beta-Total Correlation Variational Autoencoder with a Spatial Broadcast Decoder to learn a disentangled and interpretable latent embedding. We evaluate the quality of this embedding using supervised and unsupervised representation learning strategies, including auxiliary classification, triplet loss, and SimCLR-based contrastive learning. Compared to the 1D Group deep neural network (DNN) baselines, our approach improves the F1 score in a downstream sex classification task by 15.74% and shows a better disentanglement than the 3D representation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graphic design plays a vital role in visual communication across advertising, marketing, and multimedia entertainment. Prior work has explored automated graphic design generation using diffusion models, aiming to streamline creative workflows and democratize design capabilities. However, complex graphic design scenarios require accurately adhering to design intent specified by multiple heterogeneous user-provided elements (\eg images, layouts, and texts), which pose multi-condition control challenges for existing methods. Specifically, previous single-condition control models demonstrate effectiveness only within their specialized domains but fail to generalize to other conditions, while existing multi-condition methods often lack fine-grained control over each sub-condition and compromise overall compositional harmony. To address these limitations, we introduce CreatiDesign, a systematic solution for automated graphic design covering both model architecture and dataset construction. First, we design a unified multi-condition driven architecture that enables flexible and precise integration of heterogeneous design elements with minimal architectural modifications to the base diffusion model. Furthermore, to ensure that each condition precisely controls its designated image region and to avoid interference between conditions, we propose a multimodal attention mask mechanism. Additionally, we develop a fully automated pipeline for constructing graphic design datasets, and introduce a new dataset with 400K samples featuring multi-condition annotations, along with a comprehensive benchmark. Experimental results show that CreatiDesign outperforms existing models by a clear margin in faithfully adhering to user intent.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Denoising diffusion models exhibit remarkable generative capabilities, but remain challenging to train due to their inherent stochasticity, where high-variance gradient estimates lead to slow convergence. Previous works have shown that magnitude preservation helps with stabilizing training in the U-net architecture. This work explores whether this effect extends to the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. As such, we propose a magnitude-preserving design that stabilizes training without normalization layers. Motivated by the goal of maintaining activation magnitudes, we additionally introduce rotation modulation, which is a novel conditioning method using learned rotations instead of traditional scaling or shifting. Through empirical evaluations and ablation studies on small-scale models, we show that magnitude-preserving strategies significantly improve performance, notably reducing FID scores by $\sim$12.8%. Further, we show that rotation modulation combined with scaling is competitive with AdaLN, while requiring $\sim$5.4% fewer parameters. This work provides insights into conditioning strategies and magnitude control. We will publicly release the implementation of our method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have significantly accelerated image editing techniques, driving increasing demand for diverse and fine-grained edits. Despite these advances, existing image editing methods still face challenges in achieving high precision and semantic accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent studies address this issue by incorporating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into image editing pipelines. However, current MLLM-based methods mainly rely on interpreting textual instructions, leaving the intrinsic visual understanding of large models largely unexplored, thus resulting in insufficient alignment between textual semantics and visual outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose MIND-Edit, an end-to-end image-editing framework integrating pretrained diffusion model with MLLM. MIND-Edit introduces two complementary strategies: (1) a text instruction optimization strategy that clarifies ambiguous user instructions based on semantic reasoning from the MLLM, and (2) an MLLM insight-driven editing strategy that explicitly leverages the intrinsic visual understanding capability of the MLLM to infer editing intent and guide the diffusion process via generated visual embeddings. Furthermore, we propose a joint training approach to effectively integrate both strategies, allowing them to reinforce each other for more accurate instruction interpretation and visually coherent edits aligned with user intent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIND-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art image editing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly under complex and challenging scenarios.</li>

JEDI is model-agnostic and applicable to architectures such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 and 3.5, consistently improving prompt alignment and disentanglement in complex scenes. Additionally, JEDI provides a lightweight, CLIP-free disentanglement score derived from internal attention distributions, offering a principled benchmark for compositional alignment under test-time conditions.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model fine-tuning leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to align generated images with learnable reward functions. The existing approaches reformulate denoising as a Markov decision process for RL-driven optimization. However, they suffer from reward sparsity, receiving only a single delayed reward per generated trajectory. This flaw hinders precise step-level attribution of denoising actions, undermines training efficiency. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective credit assignment framework that dynamically distributes dense rewards across denoising steps. Specifically, we track changes in cosine similarity between intermediate and final images to quantify each step's contribution on progressively reducing the distance to the final image. Our approach avoids additional auxiliary neural networks for step-level preference modeling and instead uses reward shaping to highlight denoising phases that have a greater impact on image quality. Our method achieves 1.25 to 2 times higher sample efficiency and better generalization across four human preference reward functions, without compromising the original optimal policy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Segmentation is one of the most important tasks in the medical imaging pipeline as it influences a number of image-based decisions. To be effective, fully supervised segmentation approaches require large amounts of manually annotated training data. However, the pixel-level annotation process is expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, hindering progress and making it challenging to perform effective segmentations. Therefore, models must learn efficiently from limited labeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL), particularly contrastive learning via pre-training on unlabeled data and fine-tuning on limited annotations, can facilitate such limited labeled image segmentation. To this end, we propose a novel self-supervised contrastive learning framework for medical image segmentation, leveraging inherent relationships of different images, dubbed PolyCL. Without requiring any pixel-level annotations or unreasonable data augmentations, our PolyCL learns and transfers context-aware discriminant features useful for segmentation from an innovative surrogate, in a task-related manner. Additionally, we integrate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our framework in two novel ways: as a post-processing refinement module that improves the accuracy of predicted masks using bounding box prompts derived from coarse outputs, and as a propagation mechanism via SAM 2 that generates volumetric segmentations from a single annotated 2D slice. Experimental evaluations on three public computed tomography (CT) datasets demonstrate that PolyCL outperforms fully-supervised and self-supervised baselines in both low-data and cross-domain scenarios.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a core technique powering state-of-the-art image generation systems, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we begin by analyzing CFG in a simplified linear diffusion model, where we show its behavior closely resembles that observed in the nonlinear case. Our analysis reveals that linear CFG improves generation quality via three distinct components: (i) a mean-shift term that approximately steers samples in the direction of class means, (ii) a positive Contrastive Principal Components (CPC) term that amplifies class-specific features, and (iii) a negative CPC term that suppresses generic features prevalent in unconditional data. We then verify that these insights in real-world, nonlinear diffusion models: over a broad range of noise levels, linear CFG resembles the behavior of its nonlinear counterpart. Although the two eventually diverge at low noise levels, we discuss how the insights from the linear analysis still shed light on the CFG's mechanism in the nonlinear regime.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the past decade, image foundation models (IFMs) have achieved unprecedented progress. However, the potential of directly using IFMs for video self-supervised representation learning has largely been overlooked. In this study, we propose an advancing video self-supervised learning (AdViSe) approach, aimed at significantly reducing the training overhead of video representation models using pre-trained IFMs. Specifically, we first introduce temporal modeling modules (ResNet3D) to IFMs, constructing a video representation model. We then employ a video self-supervised learning approach, playback rate perception, to train temporal modules while freezing the IFM components. Experiments on UCF101 demonstrate that AdViSe achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing training time by $3.4\times$ and GPU memory usage by $8.2\times$. This study offers fresh insights into low-cost video self-supervised learning based on pre-trained IFMs. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), such as LLaDA, present a promising paradigm for language modeling, there has been relatively little effort in aligning these models with human preferences via reinforcement learning. The challenge primarily arises from the high variance in Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)-based likelihood estimates required for preference optimization. To address this issue, we propose Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization (VRPO), a framework that formally analyzes the variance of ELBO estimators and derives bounds on both the bias and variance of preference optimization gradients. Building on this theoretical foundation, we introduce unbiased variance reduction strategies, including optimal Monte Carlo budget allocation and antithetic sampling, that significantly improve the performance of MDM alignment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VRPO by applying it to LLaDA, and the resulting model, LLaDA 1.5, outperforms its SFT-only predecessor consistently and significantly across mathematical (GSM8K +4.7), code (HumanEval +3.0, MBPP +1.8), and alignment benchmarks (IFEval +4.0, Arena-Hard +4.3). Furthermore, LLaDA 1.5 demonstrates a highly competitive mathematical performance compared to strong language MDMs and ARMs. Project page: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly photorealistic visual content, offering practical substitutes for real images and videos in scenarios where acquiring real data is difficult or expensive. However, reliably substituting real visual content with AI-generated counterparts requires robust assessment of the perceived realness of AI-generated visual content, a challenging task due to its inherent subjective nature. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive human study evaluating the perceptual realness of both real and AI-generated images, resulting in a new dataset, containing images paired with subjective realness scores, introduced as RAISE in this paper. Further, we develop and train multiple models on RAISE to establish baselines for realness prediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that features derived from deep foundation vision models can effectively capture the subjective realness. RAISE thus provides a valuable resource for developing robust, objective models of perceptual realness assessment.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data-driven learning has advanced autonomous driving, yet task-specific models struggle with out-of-distribution scenarios due to their narrow optimization objectives and reliance on costly annotated data. We present DriveX, a self-supervised world model that learns generalizable scene dynamics and holistic representations (geometric, semantic, and motion) from large-scale driving videos. DriveX introduces Omni Scene Modeling (OSM), a module that unifies multimodal supervision-3D point cloud forecasting, 2D semantic representation, and image generation-to capture comprehensive scene evolution. To simplify learning complex dynamics, we propose a decoupled latent world modeling strategy that separates world representation learning from future state decoding, augmented by dynamic-aware ray sampling to enhance motion modeling. For downstream adaptation, we design Future Spatial Attention (FSA), a unified paradigm that dynamically aggregates spatiotemporal features from DriveX's predictions to enhance task-specific inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate DriveX's effectiveness: it achieves significant improvements in 3D future point cloud prediction over prior work, while attaining state-of-the-art results on diverse tasks including occupancy prediction, flow estimation, and end-to-end driving. These results validate DriveX's capability as a general-purpose world model, paving the way for robust and unified autonomous driving frameworks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current text-to-image diffusion generation typically employs complete-text conditioning. Due to the intricate syntax, diffusion transformers (DiTs) inherently suffer from a comprehension defect of complete-text captions. One-fly complete-text input either overlooks critical semantic details or causes semantic confusion by simultaneously modeling diverse semantic primitive types. To mitigate this defect of DiTs, we propose a novel split-text conditioning framework named DiT-ST. This framework converts a complete-text caption into a split-text caption, a collection of simplified sentences, to explicitly express various semantic primitives and their interconnections. The split-text caption is then injected into different denoising stages of DiT-ST in a hierarchical and incremental manner. Specifically, DiT-ST leverages Large Language Models to parse captions, extracting diverse primitives and hierarchically sorting out and constructing these primitives into a split-text input. Moreover, we partition the diffusion denoising process according to its differential sensitivities to diverse semantic primitive types and determine the appropriate timesteps to incrementally inject tokens of diverse semantic primitive types into input tokens via cross-attention. In this way, DiT-ST enhances the representation learning of specific semantic primitive types across different stages. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed DiT-ST in mitigating the complete-text comprehension defect.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Novel view synthesis in 360$^\circ$ scenes from extremely sparse input views is essential for applications like virtual reality and augmented reality. This paper presents a novel framework for novel view synthesis in extremely sparse-view cases. As typical structure-from-motion methods are unable to estimate camera poses in extremely sparse-view cases, we apply DUSt3R to estimate camera poses and generate a dense point cloud. Using the poses of estimated cameras, we densely sample additional views from the upper hemisphere space of the scenes, from which we render synthetic images together with the point cloud. Training 3D Gaussian Splatting model on a combination of reference images from sparse views and densely sampled synthetic images allows a larger scene coverage in 3D space, addressing the overfitting challenge due to the limited input in sparse-view cases. Retraining a diffusion-based image enhancement model on our created dataset, we further improve the quality of the point-cloud-rendered images by removing artifacts. We compare our framework with benchmark methods in cases of only four input views, demonstrating significant improvement in novel view synthesis under extremely sparse-view conditions for 360$^\circ$ scenes.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-embedded image generation plays a critical role in industries such as graphic design, advertising, and digital content creation. Text-to-Image generation methods leveraging diffusion models, such as TextDiffuser-2, have demonstrated promising results in producing images with embedded text. TextDiffuser-2 effectively generates bounding box layouts that guide the rendering of visual text, achieving high fidelity and coherence. However, existing approaches often rely on resource-intensive processes and are limited in their ability to run efficiently on both CPU and GPU platforms. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) for rapid and optimized text layout generation with a diffusion-based image synthesis model. Our RL-based approach significantly accelerates the bounding box prediction step while reducing overlaps, allowing the system to run efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework maintains or surpasses TextDiffuser-2's quality in text placement and image synthesis, with markedly faster runtime and increased flexibility. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework maintains or surpasses TextDiffuser-2's quality in text placement and image synthesis, with markedly faster runtime and increased flexibility. Our approach has been evaluated on the MARIOEval benchmark, achieving OCR and CLIPScore metrics close to state-of-the-art models, while being 97.64% more faster and requiring only 2MB of memory to run.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Pre-training equips text-to-image (T2I) models with broad world knowledge, but this alone is often insufficient to achieve high aesthetic quality and alignment. Consequently, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is crucial for further refinement. However, its effectiveness highly depends on the quality of the fine-tuning dataset. Existing public SFT datasets frequently target narrow domains (e.g., anime or specific art styles), and the creation of high-quality, general-purpose SFT datasets remains a significant challenge. Current curation methods are often costly and struggle to identify truly impactful samples. This challenge is further complicated by the scarcity of public general-purpose datasets, as leading models often rely on large, proprietary, and poorly documented internal data, hindering broader research progress. This paper introduces a novel methodology for creating general-purpose SFT datasets by leveraging a pre-trained generative model as an estimator of high-impact training samples. We apply this methodology to construct and release Alchemist, a compact (3,350 samples) yet highly effective SFT dataset. Experiments demonstrate that Alchemist substantially improves the generative quality of five public T2I models while preserving diversity and style. Additionally, we release the fine-tuned models' weights to the public.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite significant advances in quality and complexity of the generations in text-to-image models, prompting does not always lead to the desired outputs. Controlling model behaviour by directly steering intermediate model activations has emerged as a viable alternative allowing to reach concepts in latent space that may otherwise remain inaccessible by prompt. In this work, we introduce a set of experiments to deepen our understanding of concept reachability. We design a training data setup with three key obstacles: scarcity of concepts, underspecification of concepts in the captions, and data biases with tied concepts. Our results show: (i) concept reachability in latent space exhibits a distinct phase transition, with only a small number of samples being sufficient to enable reachability, (ii) where in the latent space the intervention is performed critically impacts reachability, showing that certain concepts are reachable only at certain stages of transformation, and (iii) while prompting ability rapidly diminishes with a decrease in quality of the dataset, concepts often remain reliably reachable through steering. Model providers can leverage this to bypass costly retraining and dataset curation and instead innovate with user-facing control mechanisms.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current text-driven image editing methods typically follow one of two directions: relying on large-scale, high-quality editing pair datasets to improve editing precision and diversity, or exploring alternative dataset-free techniques. However, constructing large-scale editing datasets requires carefully designed pipelines, is time-consuming, and often results in unrealistic samples or unwanted artifacts. Meanwhile, dataset-free methods may suffer from limited instruction comprehension and restricted editing capabilities. Faced with these challenges, the present work develops a novel paradigm for instruction-driven image editing that leverages widely available and enormous text-image pairs, instead of relying on editing pair datasets. Our approach introduces a multi-scale learnable region to localize and guide the editing process. By treating the alignment between images and their textual descriptions as supervision and learning to generate task-specific editing regions, our method achieves high-fidelity, precise, and instruction-consistent image editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach attains state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and benchmarks, while exhibiting strong adaptability to various types of generative models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A key feature of human theory-of-mind is the ability to attribute beliefs to other agents as mentalistic explanations for their behavior. But given the wide variety of beliefs that agents may hold about the world and the rich language we can use to express them, which specific beliefs are people inclined to attribute to others? In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that people prefer to attribute beliefs that are good explanations for the behavior they observe. We develop a computational model that quantifies the explanatory strength of a (natural language) statement about an agent's beliefs via three factors: accuracy, informativity, and causal relevance to actions, each of which can be computed from a probabilistic generative model of belief-driven behavior. Using this model, we study the role of each factor in how people selectively attribute beliefs to other agents. We investigate this via an experiment where participants watch an agent collect keys hidden in boxes in order to reach a goal, then rank a set of statements describing the agent's beliefs about the boxes' contents. We find that accuracy and informativity perform reasonably well at predicting these rankings when combined, but that causal relevance is the single factor that best explains participants' responses.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>State-of-the-art text-to-motion generation models rely on the kinematic-aware, local-relative motion representation popularized by HumanML3D, which encodes motion relative to the pelvis and to the previous frame with built-in redundancy. While this design simplifies training for earlier generation models, it introduces critical limitations for diffusion models and hinders applicability to downstream tasks. In this work, we revisit the motion representation and propose a radically simplified and long-abandoned alternative for text-to-motion generation: absolute joint coordinates in global space. Through systematic analysis of design choices, we show that this formulation achieves significantly higher motion fidelity, improved text alignment, and strong scalability, even with a simple Transformer backbone and no auxiliary kinematic-aware losses. Moreover, our formulation naturally supports downstream tasks such as text-driven motion control and temporal/spatial editing without additional task-specific reengineering and costly classifier guidance generation from control signals. Finally, we demonstrate promising generalization to directly generate SMPL-H mesh vertices in motion from text, laying a strong foundation for future research and motion-related applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Limited Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) often faces significant challenges due to missing angular information. Unlike previous methods that operate in the image domain, we propose a new method that focuses on sinogram inpainting. We leverage MR-SDEs, a variant of diffusion models that characterize the diffusion process with mean-reverting stochastic differential equations, to fill in missing angular data at the projection level. Furthermore, by combining distillation with constraining the output of the model using the pseudo-inverse of the inpainting matrix, the diffusion process is accelerated and done in a step, enabling efficient and accurate sinogram completion. A subsequent post-processing module back-projects the inpainted sinogram into the image domain and further refines the reconstruction, effectively suppressing artifacts while preserving critical structural details. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual and fidelity quality, offering a promising solution for LACT reconstruction in scientific and clinical applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), which are pretrained on large-scale, cross-domain data and capable of zero-shot forecasting in new scenarios without further training, are increasingly adopted in real-world applications. However, as the zero-shot forecasting paradigm gets popular, a critical yet overlooked question emerges: Are TSFMs robust to adversarial input perturbations? Such perturbations could be exploited in man-in-the-middle attacks or data poisoning. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic investigation into the adversarial robustness of TSFMs. Our results show that even minimal perturbations can induce significant and controllable changes in forecast behaviors, including trend reversal, temporal drift, and amplitude shift, posing serious risks to TSFM-based services. Through experiments on representative TSFMs and multiple datasets, we reveal their consistent vulnerabilities and identify potential architectural designs, such as structural sparsity and multi-task pretraining, that may improve robustness. Our findings offer actionable guidance for designing more resilient forecasting systems and provide a critical assessment of the adversarial robustness of TSFMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-Image (T2I) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse visual content from natural language prompts. However, uncontrolled reproduction of sensitive, copyrighted, or harmful imagery poses serious ethical, legal, and safety challenges. To address these concerns, the concept erasure paradigm has emerged as a promising direction, enabling the selective removal of specific semantic concepts from generative models while preserving their overall utility. This survey provides a comprehensive overview and in-depth synthesis of concept erasure techniques in T2I diffusion models. We systematically categorize existing approaches along three key dimensions: intervention level, which identifies specific model components targeted for concept removal; optimization structure, referring to the algorithmic strategies employed to achieve suppression; and semantic scope, concerning the complexity and nature of the concepts addressed. This multi-dimensional taxonomy enables clear, structured comparisons across diverse methodologies, highlighting fundamental trade-offs between erasure specificity, generalization, and computational complexity. We further discuss current evaluation benchmarks, standardized metrics, and practical datasets, emphasizing gaps that limit comprehensive assessment, particularly regarding robustness and practical effectiveness. Finally, we outline major challenges and promising future directions, including disentanglement of concept representations, adaptive and incremental erasure strategies, adversarial robustness, and new generative architectures. This survey aims to guide researchers toward safer, more ethically aligned generative models, providing foundational knowledge and actionable recommendations to advance responsible development in generative AI.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present LlamaSeg, a visual autoregressive framework that unifies multiple image segmentation tasks via natural language instructions. We reformulate image segmentation as a visual generation problem, representing masks as "visual" tokens and employing a LLaMA-style Transformer to predict them directly from image inputs. By adhering to the next-token prediction paradigm, our approach naturally integrates segmentation tasks into autoregressive architectures. To support large-scale training, we introduce a data annotation pipeline and construct the SA-OVRS dataset, which contains 2M segmentation masks annotated with over 5,800 open-vocabulary labels or diverse textual descriptions, covering a wide spectrum of real-world scenarios. This enables our model to localize objects in images based on text prompts and to generate fine-grained masks. To more accurately evaluate the quality of masks produced by visual generative models, we further propose a composite metric that combines Intersection over Union (IoU) with Average Hausdorff Distance (AHD), offering a more precise assessment of contour fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing generative models across multiple datasets and yields more detailed segmentation masks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enhanced their image inpainting and editing capabilities but also introduced significant societal risks. Adversaries can exploit user images from social media to generate misleading or harmful content. While adversarial perturbations can disrupt inpainting, global perturbation-based methods fail in mask-guided editing tasks due to spatial constraints. To address these challenges, we propose Structure Disruption Attack (SDA), a powerful protection framework for safeguarding sensitive image regions against inpainting-based editing. Building upon the contour-focused nature of self-attention mechanisms of diffusion models, SDA optimizes perturbations by disrupting queries in self-attention during the initial denoising step to destroy the contour generation process. This targeted interference directly disrupts the structural generation capability of diffusion models, effectively preventing them from producing coherent images. We validate our motivation through visualization techniques and extensive experiments on public datasets, demonstrating that SDA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) protection performance while maintaining strong robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning (ICL) is a crucial capability of current large language models (LLMs), where the selection of examples plays a key role in performance. While most existing approaches focus on selecting the most similar examples to the query, the impact of diversity in example selection remains underexplored. We systematically investigate the role of diversity in in-context example selection through experiments across a range of tasks, from sentiment classification to more challenging math and code problems. Experiments on Llama-3.1, Gemma-2, and Mistral-v0.3 families of models show that diversity-aware selection methods improve performance, particularly on complex tasks like math and code, and enhance robustness to out-of-distribution queries. To support these findings, we introduce a theoretical framework that explains the benefits of incorporating diversity in in-context example selection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training neural samplers directly from unnormalized densities without access to target distribution samples presents a significant challenge. A critical desideratum in these settings is achieving comprehensive mode coverage, ensuring the sampler captures the full diversity of the target distribution. However, prevailing methods often circumvent the lack of target data by optimizing reverse KL-based objectives. Such objectives inherently exhibit mode-seeking behavior, potentially leading to incomplete representation of the underlying distribution. While alternative approaches strive for better mode coverage, they typically rely on implicit mechanisms like heuristics or iterative refinement. In this work, we propose a principled approach for training diffusion-based samplers by directly targeting an objective analogous to the forward KL divergence, which is conceptually known to encourage mode coverage. We introduce \textit{Importance Weighted Score Matching}, a method that optimizes this desired mode-covering objective by re-weighting the score matching loss using tractable importance sampling estimates, thereby overcoming the absence of target distribution data. We also provide theoretical analysis of the bias and variance for our proposed Monte Carlo estimator and the practical loss function used in our method. Experiments on increasingly complex multi-modal distributions, including 2D Gaussian Mixture Models with up to 120 modes and challenging particle systems with inherent symmetries -- demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing neural samplers across all distributional distance metrics, achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Joint Energy-based Models (JEMs), a class of hybrid generative-discriminative models, are well known for their ability to achieve both high classification accuracy and generative capability within a single model. However, their robustness still lags significantly behind the classifiers based adversarial training (AT). Conversely, while AT is currently the most effective approach to improving the classifier's robustness, it typically sacrifices accuracy on clean data and lacks generative capability. The triple trade-off between classification accuracy, generative capability and robustness, raises a natural question: Can a single model simultaneously achieve high classification accuracy, adversarial robustness, and generative performance? -- a goal that has been rarely explored. To address this question, we systematically analyze the energy distribution differences of clean, adversarial, and generated samples across various JEM variants and adversarially trained models. We observe that AT tends to reduce the energy gap between clean and adversarial samples, while JEMs reduce the gap between clean and synthetic ones. This observation suggests a key insight: if the energy distributions of all three data types can be aligned, we might unify the strengths of AT and JEMs, resolving their inherent trade-offs. Building on this idea, we propose Energy-based Joint Distribution Adversarial Training (EB-JDAT), to jointly model the clean data distribution, the adversarial distribution, and the classifier by maximizing their joint probability. EB-JDAT is a general and flexible optimization method, compatible with various JEM variants. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EB-JDAT not only maintains near original accuracy and generative capability of JEMs, but also significantly enhances robustness, even surpassing state-of-the-art ATs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dataset distillation enables the training of deep neural networks with comparable performance in significantly reduced time by compressing large datasets into small and representative ones. Although the introduction of generative models has made great achievements in this field, the distributions of their distilled datasets are not diverse enough to represent the original ones, leading to a decrease in downstream validation accuracy. In this paper, we present a diversity-driven generative dataset distillation method based on a diffusion model to solve this problem. We introduce self-adaptive memory to align the distribution between distilled and real datasets, assessing the representativeness. The degree of alignment leads the diffusion model to generate more diverse datasets during the distillation process. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in most situations, proving its ability to tackle dataset distillation tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning to adapt pretrained language models to unlabeled, out-of-distribution data is a critical challenge, as models often falter on structurally novel reasoning tasks even while excelling within their training distribution. We introduce a new framework called VDS-TTT - Verifier-Driven Sample Selection for Test-Time Training to efficiently address this. We use a learned verifier to score a pool of generated responses and select only from high ranking pseudo-labeled examples for fine-tuned adaptation. Specifically, for each input query our LLM generates N candidate answers; the verifier assigns a reliability score to each, and the response with the highest confidence and above a fixed threshold is paired with its query for test-time training. We fine-tune only low-rank LoRA adapter parameters, ensuring adaptation efficiency and fast convergence. Our proposed self-supervised framework is the first to synthesize verifier driven test-time training data for continuous self-improvement of the model. Experiments across three diverse benchmarks and three state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that VDS-TTT yields up to a 32.29% relative improvement over the base model and a 6.66% gain compared to verifier-based methods without test-time training, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency for on-the-fly large language model adaptation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The increasing demand for privacy protection and security considerations leads to a significant rise in the proportion of encrypted network traffic. Since traffic content becomes unrecognizable after encryption, accurate analysis is challenging, making it difficult to classify applications and detect attacks. Deep learning is currently the predominant approach for encrypted traffic classification through feature analysis. However, these methods face limitations due to their high dependence on labeled data and difficulties in detecting attack variants. First, their performance is highly sensitive to data quality, where the highcost manual labeling process and dataset imbalance significantly degrade results. Second, the rapid evolution of attack patterns makes it challenging for models to identify new types of attacks. To tackle these challenges, we present GBC, a generative model based on pre-training for encrypted traffic comprehension. Since traditional tokenization methods are primarily designed for natural language, we propose a protocol-aware tokenization approach for encrypted traffic that improves model comprehension of fields specific to network traffic. In addition, GBC employs pretraining to learn general representations from extensive unlabeled traffic data. Through prompt learning, it effectively adapts to various downstream tasks, enabling both high-quality traffic generation and effective detection. Evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate that GBC achieves superior results in both traffic classification and generation tasks, resulting in a 5% improvement in F1 score compared to state-of-the-art methods for classification tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video action understanding tasks in real-world scenarios always suffer data limitations. In this paper, we address the data-limited action understanding problem by bridging data scarcity. We propose a novel method that employs a text-to-video diffusion transformer to generate annotated data for model training. This paradigm enables the generation of realistic annotated data on an infinite scale without human intervention. We proposed the information enhancement strategy and the uncertainty-based label smoothing tailored to generate sample training. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we observed that real samples generally contain a richer level of information than generated samples. Based on this observation, the information enhancement strategy is proposed to enhance the informative content of the generated samples from two aspects: the environments and the characters. Furthermore, we observed that some low-quality generated samples might negatively affect model training. To address this, we devised the uncertainty-based label smoothing strategy to increase the smoothing of these samples, thus reducing their impact. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on four datasets across five tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot action recognition.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Personalization using text-to-image diffusion models involves adapting a pretrained model to novel subjects with only a few image examples. This task presents a fundamental challenge, as the model must not only learn the new subject effectively but also preserve its ability to generate diverse and coherent outputs across a wide range of prompts. In other words, successful personalization requires integrating new concepts without forgetting previously learned generative capabilities. Forgetting denotes unintended distributional drift, where the model's output distribution deviates from that of the original pretrained model. In this paper, we provide an analysis of this issue and identify a mismatch between standard training objectives and the goals of personalization. To address this, we propose a new training objective based on a Lipschitz-bounded formulation that explicitly constrains deviation from the pretrained distribution. Our method provides improved control over distributional drift and performs well even in data-scarce scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing personalization methods, achieving higher CLIP-T, CLIP-I, and DINO scores.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, image classification, as a core task in computer vision, relies on high-quality labelled data, which restricts the wide application of deep learning models in practical scenarios. To alleviate the problem of insufficient labelled samples, semi-supervised learning has gradually become a research hotspot. In this paper, we construct a semi-supervised image classification model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and through the introduction of the collaborative training mechanism of generators, discriminators and classifiers, we achieve the effective use of limited labelled data and a large amount of unlabelled data, improve the quality of image generation and classification accuracy, and provide an effective solution for the task of image recognition in complex environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We address the challenge of training diffusion models to sample from unnormalized energy distributions in the absence of data, the so-called diffusion samplers. Although these approaches have shown promise, they struggle to scale in more demanding scenarios where energy evaluations are expensive and the sampling space is high-dimensional. To address this limitation, we propose a scalable and sample-efficient framework that properly harmonizes the powerful classical sampling method and the diffusion sampler. Specifically, we utilize Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) samplers with a novelty-based auxiliary energy as a Searcher to collect off-policy samples, using an auxiliary energy function to compensate for exploring modes the diffusion sampler rarely visits. These off-policy samples are then combined with on-policy data to train the diffusion sampler, thereby expanding its coverage of the energy landscape. Furthermore, we identify primacy bias, i.e., the preference of samplers for early experience during training, as the main cause of mode collapse during training, and introduce a periodic re-initialization trick to resolve this issue. Our method significantly improves sample efficiency on standard benchmarks for diffusion samplers and also excels at higher-dimensional problems and real-world molecular conformer generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Time consumption and the complexity of manual layout design make automated layout generation a critical task, especially for multiple applications across different mobile devices. Existing graph-based layout generation approaches suffer from limited generative capability, often resulting in unreasonable and incompatible outputs. Meanwhile, vision based generative models tend to overlook the original structural information, leading to component intersections and overlaps. To address these challenges, we propose an Aggregation Structural Representation (ASR) module that integrates graph networks with large language models (LLMs) to preserve structural information while enhancing generative capability. This novel pipeline utilizes graph features as hierarchical prior knowledge, replacing the traditional Vision Transformer (ViT) module in multimodal large language models (MLLM) to predict full layout information for the first time. Moreover, the intermediate graph matrix used as input for the LLM is human editable, enabling progressive, human centric design generation. A comprehensive evaluation on the RICO dataset demonstrates the strong performance of ASR, both quantitatively using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), and qualitatively through a crowdsourced user study. Additionally, sampling on relational features ensures diverse layout generation, further enhancing the adaptability and creativity of the proposed approach.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open vocabulary image segmentation tackles the challenge of recognizing dynamically adjustable, predefined novel categories at inference time by leveraging vision-language alignment. However, existing paradigms typically perform class-agnostic region segmentation followed by category matching, which deviates from the human visual system's process of recognizing objects based on semantic concepts, leading to poor alignment between region segmentation and target concepts. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Cognition-Inspired Framework for open vocabulary image segmentation that emulates the human visual recognition process: first forming a conceptual understanding of an object, then perceiving its spatial extent. The framework consists of three core components: (1) A Generative Vision-Language Model (G-VLM) that mimics human cognition by generating object concepts to provide semantic guidance for region segmentation. (2) A Concept-Aware Visual Enhancer Module that fuses textual concept features with global visual representations, enabling adaptive visual perception based on target concepts. (3) A Cognition-Inspired Decoder that integrates local instance features with G-VLM-provided semantic cues, allowing selective classification over a subset of relevant categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements, reaching $27.2$ PQ, $17.0$ mAP, and $35.3$ mIoU on A-150. It further attains $56.2$, $28.2$, $15.4$, $59.2$, $18.7$, and $95.8$ mIoU on Cityscapes, Mapillary Vistas, A-847, PC-59, PC-459, and PAS-20, respectively. In addition, our framework supports vocabulary-free segmentation, offering enhanced flexibility in recognizing unseen categories. Code will be public.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Key-Value (KV) cache in generative large language models (LLMs) introduces substantial memory overhead. Existing works mitigate this burden by offloading or compressing the KV cache. However, loading the entire cache incurs significant latency due to PCIe bandwidth bottlenecks in CPU-GPU communication, while aggressive compression causes notable performance degradation. We identify that certain layers in the LLM need to maintain global information and are unsuitable for selective loading. In contrast, other layers primarily focus on a few tokens with dominant activations that potentially incur substantial quantization error. This observation leads to a key insight that loading dominant tokens and quantizing all tokens can complement each other. Building on this insight, we propose a hybrid compression method, TailorKV, which seamlessly integrates quantization and offloading. TailorKV develops an inference framework along with a hardware-friendly implementation that leverages these complementary characteristics. Extensive long-context evaluations exhibit that TailorKV achieves nearly lossless performance under aggressive compression settings, outperforming the state-of-the-art. Particularly, the Llama-3.1-8B with 128k context can be served within a single RTX 3090 GPU, reaching 82 ms per token during decoding.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cross-lingual alignment in pretrained language models (LMs) has enabled efficient transfer in text-based LMs. Such an alignment has also been observed in speech foundation models. However, it remains an open question whether findings and methods from text-based cross-lingual alignment apply to speech. Building on prior work on spoken translation retrieval, we perform pronunciation-controlled experiments to observe if cross-lingual alignment can indeed occur in such models on a semantic basis, instead of relying on phonetic similarities. Our findings indicate that even in the absence of phonetic cues, spoken translation retrieval accuracy remains relatively stable. We follow up with a controlled experiment on a word-level dataset of cross-lingual synonyms and near-homophones, confirming the existence of both phonetic and semantic knowledge in the encoder. Finally, we qualitatively examine the transcriptions produced by early exiting the encoder, where we observe that speech translation produces semantic errors that are characterized by phonetic similarities to corresponding words in the source language. We apply this insight from early exiting to speech recognition in seven low-resource languages unsupported by the Whisper model, and achieve improved accuracy in all languages examined, particularly for languages with transparent orthographies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised image denoising methods have garnered significant research attention in recent years, for this kind of method reduces the requirement of large training datasets. Compared to supervised methods, self-supervised methods rely more on the prior embedded in deep networks themselves. As a result, most of the self-supervised methods are designed with Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures, which well capture one of the most important image prior, translation equivariant prior. Inspired by the great success achieved by the introduction of translational equivariance, in this paper, we explore the way to further incorporate another important image prior. Specifically, we first apply high-accuracy rotation equivariant convolution to self-supervised image denoising. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we have proved that simply replacing all the convolution layers with rotation equivariant convolution layers would modify the network into its rotation equivariant version. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that rotation equivariant image prior is introduced to self-supervised image denoising at the network architecture level with a comprehensive theoretical analysis of equivariance errors, which offers a new perspective to the field of self-supervised image denoising. Moreover, to further improve the performance, we design a new mask mechanism to fusion the output of rotation equivariant network and vanilla CNN-based network, and construct an adaptive rotation equivariant framework. Through extensive experiments on three typical methods, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep generative models have recently garnered significant attention across various fields, from physics to chemistry, where sampling from unnormalized Boltzmann-like distributions represents a fundamental challenge. In particular, autoregressive models and normalizing flows have become prominent due to their appealing ability to yield closed-form probability densities. Moreover, it is well-established that incorporating prior knowledge - such as symmetries - into deep neural networks can substantially improve training performances. In this context, recent advances have focused on developing symmetry-equivariant generative models, achieving remarkable results. Building upon these foundations, this paper introduces Symmetry-Enforcing Stochastic Modulation (SESaMo). Similar to equivariant normalizing flows, SESaMo enables the incorporation of inductive biases (e.g., symmetries) into normalizing flows through a novel technique called stochastic modulation. This approach enhances the flexibility of the generative model, allowing to effectively learn a variety of exact and broken symmetries. Our numerical experiments benchmark SESaMo in different scenarios, including an 8-Gaussian mixture model and physically relevant field theories, such as the $\phi^4$ theory and the Hubbard model.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize smart home assistants by enhancing their ability to accurately understand user needs and respond appropriately, which is extremely beneficial for building a smarter home environment. While recent studies have explored integrating LLMs into smart home systems, they primarily focus on handling straightforward, valid single-device operation instructions. However, real-world scenarios are far more complex and often involve users issuing invalid instructions or controlling multiple devices simultaneously. These have two main challenges: LLMs must accurately identify and rectify errors in user instructions and execute multiple user instructions perfectly. To address these challenges and advance the development of LLM-based smart home assistants, we introduce HomeBench, the first smart home dataset with valid and invalid instructions across single and multiple devices in this paper. We have experimental results on 13 distinct LLMs; e.g., GPT-4o achieves only a 0.0% success rate in the scenario of invalid multi-device instructions, revealing that the existing state-of-the-art LLMs still cannot perform well in this situation even with the help of in-context learning, retrieval-augmented generation, and fine-tuning.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose Energy-based generator matching (EGM), a modality-agnostic approach to train generative models from energy functions in the absence of data. Extending the recently proposed generator matching, EGM enables training of arbitrary continuous-time Markov processes, e.g., diffusion, flow, and jump, and can generate data from continuous, discrete, and a mixture of two modalities. To this end, we propose estimating the generator matching loss using self-normalized importance sampling with an additional bootstrapping trick to reduce variance in the importance weight. We validate EGM on both discrete and multimodal tasks up to 100 and 20 dimensions, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Discrete diffusion models are gaining traction in the visual generative area for their efficiency and compatibility. However, the pioneered attempts still fall behind the continuous counterparts, which we attribute to the noise (absorbing state) design and sampling heuristics. In this study, we propose the rehashing noise framework for discrete diffusion transformer, termed ReDDiT, to extend absorbing states and improve expressive capacity of discrete diffusion models. ReDDiT enriches the potential paths that latent variables can traverse during training with randomized multi-index corruption. The derived rehash sampler, which reverses the randomized absorbing paths, guarantees the diversity and low discrepancy of the generation process. These reformulations lead to more consistent and competitive generation quality, mitigating the need for heavily tuned randomness. Experiments show that ReDDiT significantly outperforms the baseline (reducing gFID from 6.18 to 1.61) and is on par with the continuous counterparts with higher efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The traditional process of creating labeled datasets is labor-intensive and expensive. Recent breakthroughs in open-source large language models (LLMs) have opened up a new avenue in generating labeled datasets automatically for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing an alternative to such an expensive annotation process. However, the reliability of such auto-generated labels remains a significant concern due to inherent inaccuracies. When learning from noisy labels, the model's generalization is likely to be harmed as it is prone to overfit to those label noises. While previous studies in learning from noisy labels mainly focus on synthetic noise and real-world noise, LLM-generated label noise receives less attention. In this paper, we propose SiDyP: Simplex Label Diffusion with Dynamic Prior to calibrate the classifier's prediction, thus enhancing its robustness towards LLM-generated noisy labels. SiDyP retrieves potential true label candidates by neighborhood label distribution in text embedding space and iteratively refines noisy candidates using a simplex diffusion model. Our framework can increase the performance of the BERT classifier fine-tuned on both zero-shot and few-shot LLM-generated noisy label datasets by an average of 7.21% and 7.30% respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SiDyP by conducting extensive benchmarking for different LLMs over a variety of NLP tasks. Our code is available on Github.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models for graph generation, yet their use for conditional graph generation remains a fundamental challenge. In particular, guiding diffusion models on graphs under arbitrary reward signals is difficult: gradient-based methods, while powerful, are often unsuitable due to the discrete and combinatorial nature of graphs, and non-differentiable rewards further complicate gradient-based guidance. We propose Graph Guided Diffusion (GGDiff), a novel guidance framework that interprets conditional diffusion on graphs as a stochastic control problem to address this challenge. GGDiff unifies multiple guidance strategies, including gradient-based guidance (for differentiable rewards), control-based guidance (using control signals from forward reward evaluations), and zero-order approximations (bridging gradient-based and gradient-free optimization). This comprehensive, plug-and-play framework enables zero-shot guidance of pre-trained diffusion models under both differentiable and non-differentiable reward functions, adapting well-established guidance techniques to graph generation--a direction largely unexplored. Our formulation balances computational efficiency, reward alignment, and sample quality, enabling practical conditional generation across diverse reward types. We demonstrate the efficacy of GGDiff in various tasks, including constraints on graph motifs, fairness, and link prediction, achieving superior alignment with target rewards while maintaining diversity and fidelity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Camera sensor simulation serves as a critical role for autonomous driving (AD), e.g. evaluating vision-based AD algorithms. While existing approaches have leveraged generative models for controllable image/video generation, they remain constrained to generating multi-view video sequences with fixed camera viewpoints and video frequency, significantly limiting their downstream applications. To address this, we present a generalizable camera simulation framework DriveCamSim, whose core innovation lies in the proposed Explicit Camera Modeling (ECM) mechanism. Instead of implicit interaction through vanilla attention, ECM establishes explicit pixel-wise correspondences across multi-view and multi-frame dimensions, decoupling the model from overfitting to the specific camera configurations (intrinsic/extrinsic parameters, number of views) and temporal sampling rates presented in the training data. For controllable generation, we identify the issue of information loss inherent in existing conditional encoding and injection pipelines, proposing an information-preserving control mechanism. This control mechanism not only improves conditional controllability, but also can be extended to be identity-aware to enhance temporal consistency in foreground object rendering. With above designs, our model demonstrates superior performance in both visual quality and controllability, as well as generalization capability across spatial-level (camera parameters variations) and temporal-level (video frame rate variations), enabling flexible user-customizable camera simulation tailored to diverse application scenarios.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is a critical yet challenging task aimed at inferring emotional states of individuals based on visual cues. However, existing works focus on single domains, e.g., realistic images or stickers, limiting VER models' cross-domain generalizability. To fill this gap, we introduce an Unsupervised Cross-Domain Visual Emotion Recognition (UCDVER) task, which aims to generalize visual emotion recognition from the source domain (e.g., realistic images) to the low-resource target domain (e.g., stickers) in an unsupervised manner. Compared to the conventional unsupervised domain adaptation problems, UCDVER presents two key challenges: a significant emotional expression variability and an affective distribution shift. To mitigate these issues, we propose the Knowledge-aligned Counterfactual-enhancement Diffusion Perception (KCDP) framework. Specifically, KCDP leverages a VLM to align emotional representations in a shared knowledge space and guides diffusion models for improved visual affective perception. Furthermore, a Counterfactual-Enhanced Language-image Emotional Alignment (CLIEA) method generates high-quality pseudo-labels for the target domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses SOTA models in both perceptibility and generalization, e.g., gaining 12% improvements over the SOTA VER model TGCA-PVT.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) have achieved super-human level performance on the Atari100k benchmark, driven by reinforcement learning agents trained on powerful diffusion world models. However, we identify that the current aggregates mask a major performance asymmetry: MBRL agents dramatically outperform humans in some tasks despite drastically underperforming in others, with the former inflating the aggregate metrics. This is especially pronounced in pixel-based agents trained with diffusion world models. In this work, we address the pronounced asymmetry observed in pixel-based agents as an initial attempt to reverse the worrying upward trend observed in them. We address the problematic aggregates by delineating all tasks as Agent-Optimal or Human-Optimal and advocate for equal importance on metrics from both sets. Next, we hypothesize this pronounced asymmetry is due to the lack of temporally-structured latent space trained with the World Model objective in pixel-based methods. Lastly, to address this issue, we propose Joint Embedding DIffusion (JEDI), a novel latent diffusion world model trained end-to-end with the self-consistency objective. JEDI outperforms SOTA models in human-optimal tasks while staying competitive across the Atari100k benchmark, and runs 3 times faster with 43% lower memory than the latest pixel-based diffusion baseline. Overall, our work rethinks what it truly means to cross human-level performance in Atari100k.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables clients to collaboratively train models while preserving data privacy. However, the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity gives rise to inconsistent representations and divergent optimization dynamics across clients, ultimately hindering robust global performance. To transcend these challenges, we propose Mosaic, a novel data-free knowledge distillation framework tailored for heterogeneous distributed environments. Mosaic first trains local generative models to approximate each client's personalized distribution, enabling synthetic data generation that safeguards privacy through strict separation from real data. Subsequently, Mosaic forms a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) from client models based on their specialized knowledge, and distills it into a global model using the generated data. To further enhance the MoE architecture, Mosaic integrates expert predictions via a lightweight meta model trained on a few representative prototypes. Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that Mosaic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under both model and data heterogeneity.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper investigates the connections between rectified flows, flow matching, and optimal transport. Flow matching is a recent approach to learning generative models by estimating velocity fields that guide transformations from a source to a target distribution. Rectified flow matching aims to straighten the learned transport paths, yielding more direct flows between distributions. Our first contribution is a set of invariance properties of rectified flows and explicit velocity fields. In addition, we also provide explicit constructions and analysis in the Gaussian (not necessarily independent) and Gaussian mixture settings and study the relation to optimal transport. Our second contribution addresses recent claims suggesting that rectified flows, when constrained such that the learned velocity field is a gradient, can yield (asymptotically) solutions to optimal transport problems. We study the existence of solutions for this problem and demonstrate that they only relate to optimal transport under assumptions that are significantly stronger than those previously acknowledged. In particular, we present several counter-examples that invalidate earlier equivalence results in the literature, and we argue that enforcing a gradient constraint on rectified flows is, in general, not a reliable method for computing optimal transport maps.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, the pretrain-finetune paradigm has become a cornerstone in various deep learning areas. While in general the pre-trained model would promote both effectiveness and efficiency of downstream tasks fine-tuning, studies have shown that not all knowledge acquired during pre-training is beneficial. Some of the knowledge may actually bring detrimental effects to the fine-tuning tasks, which is also known as negative transfer. To address this problem, graceful forgetting has emerged as a promising approach. The core principle of graceful forgetting is to enhance the learning plasticity of the target task by selectively discarding irrelevant knowledge. However, this approach remains underexplored in the context of generative language models, and it is often challenging to migrate existing forgetting algorithms to these models due to architecture incompatibility. To bridge this gap, in this paper we propose a novel framework, Learning With Forgetting (LWF), to achieve graceful forgetting in generative language models. With Fisher Information Matrix weighting the intended parameter updates, LWF computes forgetting confidence to evaluate self-generated knowledge regarding the forgetting task, and consequently, knowledge with high confidence is periodically unlearned during fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that, although thoroughly uncovering the mechanisms of knowledge interaction remains challenging in pre-trained language models, applying graceful forgetting can contribute to enhanced fine-tuning performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurately delineating the visual pathway (VP) is crucial for understanding the human visual system and diagnosing related disorders. Exploring multi-parametric MR imaging data has been identified as an important way to delineate VP. However, due to the complex cross-sequence relationships, existing methods cannot effectively model the complementary information from different MRI sequences. In addition, these existing methods heavily rely on large training data with labels, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming to obtain. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-parametric feature decomposition framework for VP delineation. Specifically, a correlation-constrained feature decomposition (CFD) is designed to handle the complex cross-sequence relationships by capturing the unique characteristics of each MRI sequence and easing the multi-parametric information fusion process. Furthermore, a consistency-based sample enhancement (CSE) module is developed to address the limited labeled data issue, by generating and promoting meaningful edge information from unlabeled data. We validate our framework using two public datasets, and one in-house Multi-Shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of delineation performance when compared to seven state-of-the-art approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human-centered images often suffer from severe generic degradation during transmission and are prone to human motion blur (HMB), making restoration challenging. Existing research lacks sufficient focus on these issues, as both problems often coexist in practice. To address this, we design a degradation pipeline that simulates the coexistence of HMB and generic noise, generating synthetic degraded data to train our proposed HAODiff, a human-aware one-step diffusion. Specifically, we propose a triple-branch dual-prompt guidance (DPG), which leverages high-quality images, residual noise (LQ minus HQ), and HMB segmentation masks as training targets. It produces a positive-negative prompt pair for classifier-free guidance (CFG) in a single diffusion step. The resulting adaptive dual prompts let HAODiff exploit CFG more effectively, boosting robustness against diverse degradations. For fair evaluation, we introduce MPII-Test, a benchmark rich in combined noise and HMB cases. Extensive experiments show that our HAODiff surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality on synthetic and real-world datasets, including our introduced MPII-Test.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this technical report, we present our solution to the CVPR 2025 Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection (VAND) 3.0 Workshop Challenge Track 1: Adapt & Detect: Robust Anomaly Detection in Real-World Applications. In real-world industrial anomaly detection, it is crucial to accurately identify anomalies with physical complexity, such as transparent or reflective surfaces, occlusions, and low-contrast contaminations. The recently proposed MVTec AD 2 dataset significantly narrows the gap between publicly available benchmarks and anomalies found in real-world industrial environments. To address the challenges posed by this dataset--such as complex and varying lighting conditions and real anomalies with large scale differences--we propose a fully training-free anomaly detection and segmentation method based on feature extraction using the DINOv2 model named SuperAD. Our method carefully selects a small number of normal reference images and constructs a memory bank by leveraging the strong representational power of DINOv2. Anomalies are then segmented by performing nearest neighbor matching between test image features and the memory bank. Our method achieves competitive results on both test sets of the MVTec AD 2 dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Intrinsic image decomposition aims at separating an image into its underlying albedo and shading components, isolating the base color from lighting effects to enable downstream applications such as virtual relighting and scene editing. Despite the rise and success of learning-based approaches, intrinsic image decomposition from real-world images remains a significant challenging task due to the scarcity of labeled ground-truth data. Most existing solutions rely on synthetic data as supervised setups, limiting their ability to generalize to real-world scenes. Self-supervised methods, on the other hand, often produce albedo maps that contain reflections and lack consistency under different lighting conditions. To address this, we propose SAIL, an approach designed to estimate albedo-like representations from single-view real-world images. We repurpose the prior knowledge of a latent diffusion model for unconditioned scene relighting as a surrogate objective for albedo estimation. To extract the albedo, we introduce a novel intrinsic image decomposition fully formulated in the latent space. To guide the training of our latent diffusion model, we introduce regularization terms that constrain both the lighting-dependent and independent components of our latent image decomposition. SAIL predicts stable albedo under varying lighting conditions and generalizes to multiple scenes, using only unlabeled multi-illumination data available online.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Discrete diffusion has recently emerged as a promising paradigm in discrete data modeling. However, existing methods typically rely on a fixed rate transition matrix during training, which not only limits the expressiveness of latent representations, a fundamental strength of variational methods, but also constrains the overall design space. To address these limitations, we propose Discrete Markov Bridge, a novel framework specifically designed for discrete representation learning. Our approach is built upon two key components: Matrix Learning and Score Learning. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing formal performance guarantees for Matrix Learning and proving the convergence of the overall framework. Furthermore, we analyze the space complexity of our method, addressing practical constraints identified in prior studies. Extensive empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed Discrete Markov Bridge, which achieves an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of 1.38 on the Text8 dataset, outperforming established baselines. Moreover, the proposed model demonstrates competitive performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving results comparable to those obtained by image-specific generation approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Equivariant and invariant deep learning models have been developed to exploit intrinsic symmetries in data, demonstrating significant effectiveness in certain scenarios. However, these methods often suffer from limited representation accuracy and rely on strict symmetry assumptions that may not hold in practice. These limitations pose a significant drawback for image restoration tasks, which demands high accuracy and precise symmetry representation. To address these challenges, we propose a rotation-equivariant regularization strategy that adaptively enforces the appropriate symmetry constraints on the data while preserving the network's representational accuracy. Specifically, we introduce EQ-Reg, a regularizer designed to enhance rotation equivariance, which innovatively extends the insights of data-augmentation-based and equivariant-based methodologies. This is achieved through self-supervised learning and the spatial rotation and cyclic channel shift of feature maps deduce in the equivariant framework. Our approach firstly enables a non-strictly equivariant network suitable for image restoration, providing a simple and adaptive mechanism for adjusting equivariance based on task. Extensive experiments across three low-level tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization capability of our method, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current research on tabular foundation models often overlooks the complexities of large-scale, real-world data by treating tables as isolated entities and assuming information completeness, thereby neglecting the vital operational context. To address this, we introduce the concept of Semantically Linked Tables (SLT), recognizing that tables are inherently connected to both declarative and procedural operational knowledge. We propose Foundation Models for Semantically Linked Tables (FMSLT), which integrate these components to ground tabular data within its true operational context. This comprehensive representation unlocks the full potential of machine learning for complex, interconnected tabular data across diverse domains. Realizing FMSLTs requires access to operational knowledge that is often unavailable in public datasets, highlighting the need for close collaboration between domain experts and researchers. Our work exposes the limitations of current tabular foundation models and proposes a new direction centered on FMSLTs, aiming to advance robust, context-aware models for structured data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language Model (LLM) unlearning, i.e., selectively removing information from LLMs, is vital for responsible model deployment. Differently, LLM knowledge editing aims to modify LLM knowledge instead of removing it. Though editing and unlearning seem to be two distinct tasks, we find there is a tight connection between them. In this paper, we conceptualize unlearning as a special case of editing where information is modified to a refusal or "empty set" $\emptyset$ response, signifying its removal. This paper thus investigates if knowledge editing techniques are strong baselines for LLM unlearning. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) editing methods (e.g., ROME, MEMIT, GRACE, WISE, and AlphaEdit) against existing unlearning approaches on pretrained and finetuned knowledge. Results show certain editing methods, notably WISE and AlphaEdit, are effective unlearning baselines, especially for pretrained knowledge, and excel in generating human-aligned refusal answers. To better adapt editing methods for unlearning applications, we propose practical recipes including self-improvement and query merging. The former leverages the LLM's own in-context learning ability to craft a more human-aligned unlearning target, and the latter enables ROME and MEMIT to perform well in unlearning longer sample sequences. We advocate for the unlearning community to adopt SOTA editing methods as baselines and explore unlearning from an editing perspective for more holistic LLM memory control.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce FruitNeRF++, a novel fruit-counting approach that combines contrastive learning with neural radiance fields to count fruits from unstructured input photographs of orchards. Our work is based on FruitNeRF, which employs a neural semantic field combined with a fruit-specific clustering approach. The requirement for adaptation for each fruit type limits the applicability of the method, and makes it difficult to use in practice. To lift this limitation, we design a shape-agnostic multi-fruit counting framework, that complements the RGB and semantic data with instance masks predicted by a vision foundation model. The masks are used to encode the identity of each fruit as instance embeddings into a neural instance field. By volumetrically sampling the neural fields, we extract a point cloud embedded with the instance features, which can be clustered in a fruit-agnostic manner to obtain the fruit count. We evaluate our approach using a synthetic dataset containing apples, plums, lemons, pears, peaches, and mangoes, as well as a real-world benchmark apple dataset. Our results demonstrate that FruitNeRF++ is easier to control and compares favorably to other state-of-the-art methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the recent success of world-model agents, which extend the core idea of model-based reinforcement learning by learning a differentiable model for sample-efficient control across diverse tasks, active inference (AIF) offers a complementary, neuroscience-grounded paradigm that unifies perception, learning, and action within a single probabilistic framework powered by a generative model. Despite this promise, practical AIF agents still rely on accurate immediate predictions and exhaustive planning, a limitation that is exacerbated in delayed environments requiring plans over long horizons, tens to hundreds of steps. Moreover, most existing agents are evaluated on robotic or vision benchmarks which, while natural for biological agents, fall short of real-world industrial complexity. We address these limitations with a generative-policy architecture featuring (i) a multi-step latent transition that lets the generative model predict an entire horizon in a single look-ahead, (ii) an integrated policy network that enables the transition and receives gradients of the expected free energy, (iii) an alternating optimization scheme that updates model and policy from a replay buffer, and (iv) a single gradient step that plans over long horizons, eliminating exhaustive planning from the control loop. We evaluate our agent in an environment that mimics a realistic industrial scenario with delayed and long-horizon settings. The empirical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating the coupled world-model with the AIF formalism yields an end-to-end probabilistic controller capable of effective decision making in delayed, long-horizon settings without handcrafted rewards or expensive planning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies show that simple training-free techniques can dramatically improve the quality of text-to-2D generation outputs, e.g. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) or FreeU. However, these training-free techniques have been underexplored in the lens of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which is a popular and effective technique to leverage the power of pretrained text-to-2D diffusion models for various tasks. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the effect such training-free techniques have on SDS, via a particular application of text-to-3D generation via 2D lifting. We present our findings, which show that varying the scales of CFG presents a trade-off between object size and surface smoothness, while varying the scales of FreeU presents a trade-off between texture details and geometric errors. Based on these findings, we provide insights into how we can effectively harness training-free techniques for SDS, via a strategic scaling of such techniques in a dynamic manner with respect to the timestep or optimization iteration step. We show that using our proposed scheme strikes a favorable balance between texture details and surface smoothness in text-to-3D generations, while preserving the size of the output and mitigating the occurrence of geometric defects.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the current research landscape, multimodal autoregressive (AR) models have shown exceptional capabilities across various domains, including visual understanding and generation. However, complex tasks such as style-aligned text-to-image generation present significant challenges, particularly in data acquisition. In analogy to instruction-following tuning for image editing of AR models, style-aligned generation requires a reference style image and prompt, resulting in a text-image-to-image triplet where the output shares the style and semantics of the input. However, acquiring large volumes of such triplet data with specific styles is considerably more challenging than obtaining conventional text-to-image data used for training generative models. To address this issue, we propose StyleAR, an innovative approach that combines a specially designed data curation method with our proposed AR models to effectively utilize text-to-image binary data for style-aligned text-to-image generation. Our method synthesizes target stylized data using a reference style image and prompt, but only incorporates the target stylized image as the image modality to create high-quality binary data. To facilitate binary data training, we introduce a CLIP image encoder with a perceiver resampler that translates the image input into style tokens aligned with multimodal tokens in AR models and implement a style-enhanced token technique to prevent content leakage which is a common issue in previous work. Furthermore, we mix raw images drawn from large-scale text-image datasets with stylized images to enhance StyleAR's ability to extract richer stylistic features and ensure style consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate our superior performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate its effectiveness in tackling complex visual tasks. However, existing MLLM-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods remain limited to shallow anomaly descriptions without deep reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new task named Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which aims to enable deep analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video by requiring MLLMs to think explicitly before answering. To this end, we propose Vad-R1, an end-to-end MLLM-based framework for VAR. Specifically, we design a Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human process of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly step-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a dedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with limited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves superior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on VAD and VAR tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning (FL) aims to train models across decentralized clients or devices holding local data without the need for centralized data collection, thus enhancing data privacy and security. However, achieving both generalization and personalization in heterogeneous settings remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce FedOT, a novel approach that leverages black-box foundation models. FedOT shares only a global task-dependent classifier across clients while locally adapting features through orthogonal transformations. By enforcing orthogonality, FedOT mitigates gradient conflicts across diverse clients, preserves semantic integrity, and achieves robust performance even in the presence of substantial data heterogeneity. The strategy of combining global and local parameters enables a more balanced approach for both generalization and personalization, outperforming baseline FL methods across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, our extensive analysis confirms that joint optimization of global classifiers and local orthogonal transformations yields superior performance and suggests broader applicability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Underwater images are often affected by complex degradations such as light absorption, scattering, color casts, and artifacts, making enhancement critical for effective object detection, recognition, and scene understanding in aquatic environments. Existing methods, especially diffusion-based approaches, typically rely on synthetic paired datasets due to the scarcity of real underwater references, introducing bias and limiting generalization. Furthermore, fine-tuning these models can degrade learned priors, resulting in unrealistic enhancements due to domain shifts. To address these challenges, we propose UDAN-CLIP, an image-to-image diffusion framework pre-trained on synthetic underwater datasets and enhanced with a customized classifier based on vision-language model, a spatial attention module, and a novel CLIP-Diffusion loss. The classifier preserves natural in-air priors and semantically guides the diffusion process, while the spatial attention module focuses on correcting localized degradations such as haze and low contrast. The proposed CLIP-Diffusion loss further strengthens visual-textual alignment and helps maintain semantic consistency during enhancement. The proposed contributions empower our UDAN-CLIP model to perform more effective underwater image enhancement, producing results that are not only visually compelling but also more realistic and detail-preserving. These improvements are consistently validated through both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual comparisons, demonstrating the model's ability to correct distortions and restore natural appearance in challenging underwater conditions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in image-to-video (I2V) generation have shown promising performance in conventional scenarios. However, these methods still encounter significant challenges when dealing with complex scenes that require a deep understanding of nuanced motion and intricate object-action relationships. To address these challenges, we present Dynamic-I2V, an innovative framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to jointly encode visual and textual conditions for a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture. By leveraging the advanced multimodal understanding capabilities of MLLMs, our model significantly improves motion controllability and temporal coherence in synthesized videos. The inherent multimodality of Dynamic-I2V further enables flexible support for diverse conditional inputs, extending its applicability to various downstream generation tasks. Through systematic analysis, we identify a critical limitation in current I2V benchmarks: a significant bias towards favoring low-dynamic videos, stemming from an inadequate balance between motion complexity and visual quality metrics. To resolve this evaluation gap, we propose DIVE - a novel assessment benchmark specifically designed for comprehensive dynamic quality measurement in I2V generation. In conclusion, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments confirm that Dynamic-I2V attains state-of-the-art performance in image-to-video generation, particularly revealing significant improvements of 42.5%, 7.9%, and 11.8% in dynamic range, controllability, and quality, respectively, as assessed by the DIVE metric in comparison to existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Task-oriented semantic communication enhances transmission efficiency by conveying semantic information rather than exact messages. Deep learning (DL)-based semantic communication can effectively cultivate the essential semantic knowledge for semantic extraction, transmission, and interpretation by leveraging massive labeled samples for downstream task training. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning-based semantic communication framework (SLSCom) to enhance task inference performance, particularly in scenarios with limited access to labeled samples. Specifically, we develop a task-relevant semantic encoder using unlabeled samples, which can be collected by devices in real-world edge networks. To facilitate task-relevant semantic extraction, we introduce self-supervision for learning contrastive features and formulate the information bottleneck (IB) problem to balance the tradeoff between the informativeness of the extracted features and task inference performance. Given the computational challenges of the IB problem, we devise a practical and effective solution by employing self-supervised classification and reconstruction pretext tasks. We further propose efficient joint training methods to enhance end-to-end inference accuracy over wireless channels, even with few labeled samples. We evaluate the proposed framework on image classification tasks over multipath wireless channels. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that SLSCom significantly outperforms conventional digital coding methods and existing DL-based approaches across varying labeled data set sizes and SNR conditions, even when the unlabeled samples are irrelevant to the downstream tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias is a challenging clinical task, mainly because of the overlap in symptom presentation and the similarity of patterns observed in structural neuroimaging. To improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, deep learning-based methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers have been proposed for the automatic classification of brain MRIs. However, despite their strong predictive performance, these models find limited clinical utility due to their opaque decision making. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates two core components to enhance diagnostic transparency. First, we introduce a modular pipeline for converting 3D T1-weighted brain MRIs into textual radiology reports. Second, we explore the potential of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist clinicians in the differential diagnosis between Frontotemporal dementia subtypes, Alzheimer's disease, and normal aging based on the generated reports. To bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and explainability, we employ reinforcement learning to incentivize diagnostic reasoning in LLMs. Without requiring supervised reasoning traces or distillation from larger models, our approach enables the emergence of structured diagnostic rationales grounded in neuroimaging findings. Unlike post-hoc explainability methods that retrospectively justify model decisions, our framework generates diagnostic rationales as part of the inference process-producing causally grounded explanations that inform and guide the model's decision-making process. In doing so, our framework matches the diagnostic performance of existing deep learning methods while offering rationales that support its diagnostic conclusions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have shown great potential in generating realistic image detail. However, adapting these models to video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and lack of temporal modeling. In this paper, we propose UltraVSR, a novel framework that enables ultra-realistic and temporal-coherent VSR through an efficient one-step diffusion space. A central component of UltraVSR is the Degradation-aware Restoration Schedule (DRS), which estimates a degradation factor from the low-resolution input and transforms iterative denoising process into a single-step reconstruction from from low-resolution to high-resolution videos. This design eliminates randomness from diffusion noise and significantly speeds up inference. To ensure temporal consistency, we propose a lightweight yet effective Recurrent Temporal Shift (RTS) module, composed of an RTS-convolution unit and an RTS-attention unit. By partially shifting feature components along the temporal dimension, these two units collaboratively facilitate effective feature propagation, fusion, and alignment across neighboring frames, without relying on explicit temporal layers. The RTS module is integrated into a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is further enhanced through Spatio-temporal Joint Distillation (SJD), which improves temporal coherence while preserving realistic details. Additionally, we introduce a Temporally Asynchronous Inference (TAI) strategy to capture long-range temporal dependencies under limited memory constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in a single sampling step.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks during inference using only a few demonstrations. However, ICL performance is highly dependent on the selection of these demonstrations. Recent work explores retrieval-based methods for selecting query-specific demonstrations, but these approaches often rely on surrogate objectives such as metric learning, failing to directly optimize ICL performance. Consequently, they struggle to identify truly beneficial demonstrations. Moreover, their discriminative retrieval paradigm is ineffective when the candidate pool lacks sufficient high-quality demonstrations. To address these challenges, we propose GenICL, a novel generative preference learning framework that leverages LLM feedback to directly optimize demonstration selection for ICL. Experiments on 19 datasets across 11 task categories demonstrate that GenICL achieves superior performance than existing methods in selecting the most effective demonstrations, leading to better ICL performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) offer a computationally scalable framework for generative modeling, supporting exact and efficient inference of a wide range of probabilistic queries. While recent advances have significantly improved the expressiveness and scalability of PCs, effectively training their parameters remains a challenge. In particular, a widely used optimization method, full-batch Expectation-Maximization (EM), requires processing the entire dataset before performing a single update, making it ineffective for large datasets. While empirical extensions to the mini-batch setting have been proposed, it remains unclear what objective these algorithms are optimizing, making it difficult to assess their theoretical soundness. This paper bridges the gap by establishing a novel connection between the general EM objective and the standard full-batch EM algorithm. Building on this, we derive a theoretically grounded generalization to the mini-batch setting and demonstrate its effectiveness through preliminary empirical results.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hollmann et al. (Nature 637 (2025) 319-326) recently introduced TabPFN, a transformer-based deep learning model for regression and classification on tabular data, which they claim "outperforms all previous methods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples by a wide margin, using substantially less training time." Furthermore, they have called TabPFN a "foundation model" for tabular data, as it can support "data generation, density estimation, learning reusable embeddings and fine-tuning". If these statements are well-supported, TabPFN may have the potential to supersede existing modeling approaches on a wide range of statistical tasks, mirroring a similar revolution in other areas of artificial intelligence that began with the advent of large language models. In this paper, we provide a tailored explanation of how TabPFN works for a statistics audience, by emphasizing its interpretation as approximate Bayesian inference. We also provide more evidence of TabPFN's "foundation model" capabilities: We show that an out-of-the-box application of TabPFN vastly outperforms specialized state-of-the-art methods for semi-supervised parameter estimation, prediction under covariate shift, and heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. We further show that TabPFN can outperform LASSO at sparse regression and can break a robustness-efficiency trade-off in classification.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Due to the powerful vision-language reasoning and generalization abilities, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention in the field of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, their application to closed-loop systems remains underexplored, and current MLLM-based methods have not shown clear superiority to mainstream E2E imitation learning approaches. In this work, we propose ReasonPlan, a novel MLLM fine-tuning framework designed for closed-loop driving through holistic reasoning with a self-supervised Next Scene Prediction task and supervised Decision Chain-of-Thought process. This dual mechanism encourages the model to align visual representations with actionable driving context, while promoting interpretable and causally grounded decision making. We curate a planning-oriented decision reasoning dataset, namely PDR, comprising 210k diverse and high-quality samples. Our method outperforms the mainstream E2E imitation learning method by a large margin of 19% L2 and 16.1 driving score on Bench2Drive benchmark. Furthermore, ReasonPlan demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on unseen DOS benchmark, highlighting its adaptability in handling zero-shot corner cases.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose Gradient Inversion Transcript (GIT), a novel generative approach for reconstructing training data from leaked gradients. GIT employs a generative attack model, whose architecture is tailored to align with the structure of the leaked model based on theoretical analysis. Once trained offline, GIT can be deployed efficiently and only relies on the leaked gradients to reconstruct the input data, rendering it applicable under various distributed learning environments. When used as a prior for other iterative optimization-based methods, GIT not only accelerates convergence but also enhances the overall reconstruction quality. GIT consistently outperforms existing methods across multiple datasets and demonstrates strong robustness under challenging conditions, including inaccurate gradients, data distribution shifts and discrepancies in model parameters.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dynamics modeling has been introduced as a novel paradigm in message passing (MP) of graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing methods consider MP between nodes as a heat diffusion process, and leverage heat equation to model the temporal evolution of nodes in the embedding space. However, heat equation can hardly depict the wave nature of graph signals in graph signal processing. Besides, heat equation is essentially a partial differential equation (PDE) involving a first partial derivative of time, whose numerical solution usually has low stability, and leads to inefficient model training. In this paper, we would like to depict more wave details in MP, since graph signals are essentially wave signals that can be seen as a superposition of a series of waves in the form of eigenvector. This motivates us to consider MP as a wave propagation process to capture the temporal evolution of wave signals in the space. Based on wave equation in physics, we innovatively develop a graph wave equation to leverage the wave propagation on graphs. In details, we demonstrate that the graph wave equation can be connected to traditional spectral GNNs, facilitating the design of graph wave networks based on various Laplacians and enhancing the performance of the spectral GNNs. Besides, the graph wave equation is particularly a PDE involving a second partial derivative of time, which has stronger stability on graphs than the heat equation that involves a first partial derivative of time. Additionally, we theoretically prove that the numerical solution derived from the graph wave equation are constantly stable, enabling to significantly enhance model efficiency while ensuring its performance. Extensive experiments show that GWNs achieve SOTA and efficient performance on benchmark datasets, and exhibit outstanding performance in addressing challenging graph problems, such as over-smoothing and heterophily.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have become the mainstream architecture for text-to-image generation, achieving remarkable progress in visual quality and prompt controllability. However, current inference pipelines generally lack interpretable semantic supervision and correction mechanisms throughout the denoising process. Most existing approaches rely solely on post-hoc scoring of the final image, prompt filtering, or heuristic resampling strategies-making them ineffective in providing actionable guidance for correcting the generative trajectory. As a result, models often suffer from object confusion, spatial errors, inaccurate counts, and missing semantic elements, severely compromising prompt-image alignment and image quality. To tackle these challenges, we propose MLLM Semantic-Corrected Ping-Pong-Ahead Diffusion (PPAD), a novel framework that, for the first time, introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a semantic observer during inference. PPAD performs real-time analysis on intermediate generations, identifies latent semantic inconsistencies, and translates feedback into controllable signals that actively guide the remaining denoising steps. The framework supports both inference-only and training-enhanced settings, and performs semantic correction at only extremely few diffusion steps, offering strong generality and scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPAD's significant improvements.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Computational dance generation is crucial in many areas, such as art, human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and digital entertainment, particularly for generating coherent and expressive long dance sequences. Diffusion-based music-to-dance generation has made significant progress, yet existing methods still struggle to produce physically plausible motions. To address this, we propose Plausibility-Aware Motion Diffusion (PAMD), a framework for generating dances that are both musically aligned and physically realistic. The core of PAMD lies in the Plausible Motion Constraint (PMC), which leverages Neural Distance Fields (NDFs) to model the actual pose manifold and guide generated motions toward a physically valid pose manifold. To provide more effective guidance during generation, we incorporate Prior Motion Guidance (PMG), which uses standing poses as auxiliary conditions alongside music features. To further enhance realism for complex movements, we introduce the Motion Refinement with Foot-ground Contact (MRFC) module, which addresses foot-skating artifacts by bridging the gap between the optimization objective in linear joint position space and the data representation in nonlinear rotation space. Extensive experiments show that PAMD significantly improves musical alignment and enhances the physical plausibility of generated motions. This project page is available at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-multiview (T2MV) generation, which produces coherent multiview images from a single text prompt, remains computationally intensive, while accelerated T2MV methods using few-step diffusion models often sacrifice image fidelity and view consistency. To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning framework tailored for few-step T2MV diffusion models to jointly optimize per-view fidelity and cross-view consistency. Specifically, we first reformulate T2MV denoising across all views as a single unified Markov decision process, enabling multiview-aware policy optimization driven by a joint-view reward objective. Next, we introduce ZMV-Sampling, a test-time T2MV sampling technique that adds an inversion-denoising pass to reinforce both viewpoint and text conditioning, resulting in improved T2MV generation at the cost of inference time. To internalize its performance gains into the base sampling policy, we develop MV-ZigAL, a novel policy optimization strategy that uses reward advantages of ZMV-Sampling over standard sampling as learning signals for policy updates. Finally, noting that the joint-view reward objective under-optimizes per-view fidelity but naively optimizing single-view metrics neglects cross-view alignment, we reframe RL finetuning for T2MV diffusion models as a constrained optimization problem that maximizes per-view fidelity subject to an explicit joint-view constraint, thereby enabling more efficient and balanced policy updates. By integrating this constrained optimization paradigm with MV-ZigAL, we establish our complete RL finetuning framework, referred to as MVC-ZigAL, which effectively refines the few-step T2MV diffusion baseline in both fidelity and consistency while preserving its few-step efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a promising class of generative models designed to sample diverse, high-reward structures by modeling distributions over compositional objects. In many real-world applications, obtaining the reward function for such objects is expensive, time-consuming, or requires human input, making it necessary to train GFlowNets from historical datasets. Most existing methods adopt a model-based approach, learning a proxy model from the dataset to approximate the reward function. However, this strategy inherently ties the quality of the learned policy to the accuracy of the proxy, introducing additional complexity and uncertainty into the training process. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Trajectory-Distilled GFlowNet (TD-GFN)}, a \emph{proxy-free} training framework that eliminates the need for out-of-dataset reward queries. Our method is motivated by the key observation that different edges in the associated directed acyclic graph (DAG) contribute unequally to effective policy learning. TD-GFN leverages inverse reinforcement learning to estimate edge-level rewards from the offline dataset, which are then used to ingeniously prune the DAG and guide backward trajectory sampling during training. This approach directs the policy toward high-reward regions while reducing the complexity of model fitting. Empirical results across multiple tasks show that TD-GFN trains both efficiently and reliably, significantly outperforming existing baselines in convergence speed and sample quality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, capable of producing high-quality samples that generalize beyond the training data. However, evaluating this generalization remains challenging: theoretical metrics are often impractical for high-dimensional data, while no practical metrics rigorously measure generalization. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing probability flow distance ($\texttt{PFD}$), a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient metric to measure distributional generalization. Specifically, $\texttt{PFD}$ quantifies the distance between distributions by comparing their noise-to-data mappings induced by the probability flow ODE. Moreover, by using $\texttt{PFD}$ under a teacher-student evaluation protocol, we empirically uncover several key generalization behaviors in diffusion models, including: (1) scaling behavior from memorization to generalization, (2) early learning and double descent training dynamics, and (3) bias-variance decomposition. Beyond these insights, our work lays a foundation for future empirical and theoretical studies on generalization in diffusion models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Molecular editing aims to modify a given molecule to optimize desired chemical properties while preserving structural similarity. However, current approaches typically rely on string-based or continuous representations, which fail to adequately capture the discrete, graph-structured nature of molecules, resulting in limited structural fidelity and poor controllability. In this paper, we propose MolEditRL, a molecular editing framework that explicitly integrates structural constraints with precise property optimization. Specifically, MolEditRL consists of two stages: (1) a discrete graph diffusion model pretrained to reconstruct target molecules conditioned on source structures and natural language instructions; (2) an editing-aware reinforcement learning fine-tuning stage that further enhances property alignment and structural preservation by explicitly optimizing editing decisions under graph constraints. For comprehensive evaluation, we construct MolEdit-Instruct, the largest and most property-rich molecular editing dataset, comprising 3 million diverse examples spanning single- and multi-property tasks across 10 chemical attributes. Experimental results demonstrate that MolEditRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both property optimization accuracy and structural fidelity, achieving a 74\% improvement in editing success rate while using 98\% fewer parameters.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent years have witnessed significant progress in audio-driven human animation. However, critical challenges remain in (i) generating highly dynamic videos while preserving character consistency, (ii) achieving precise emotion alignment between characters and audio, and (iii) enabling multi-character audio-driven animation. To address these challenges, we propose HunyuanVideo-Avatar, a multimodal diffusion transformer (MM-DiT)-based model capable of simultaneously generating dynamic, emotion-controllable, and multi-character dialogue videos. Concretely, HunyuanVideo-Avatar introduces three key innovations: (i) A character image injection module is designed to replace the conventional addition-based character conditioning scheme, eliminating the inherent condition mismatch between training and inference. This ensures the dynamic motion and strong character consistency; (ii) An Audio Emotion Module (AEM) is introduced to extract and transfer the emotional cues from an emotion reference image to the target generated video, enabling fine-grained and accurate emotion style control; (iii) A Face-Aware Audio Adapter (FAA) is proposed to isolate the audio-driven character with latent-level face mask, enabling independent audio injection via cross-attention for multi-character scenarios. These innovations empower HunyuanVideo-Avatar to surpass state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets and a newly proposed wild dataset, generating realistic avatars in dynamic, immersive scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video diffusion models have recently shown promise for world modeling through autoregressive frame prediction conditioned on actions. However, they struggle to maintain long-term memory due to the high computational cost associated with processing extended sequences in attention layers. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel architecture leveraging state-space models (SSMs) to extend temporal memory without compromising computational efficiency. Unlike previous approaches that retrofit SSMs for non-causal vision tasks, our method fully exploits the inherent advantages of SSMs in causal sequence modeling. Central to our design is a block-wise SSM scanning scheme, which strategically trades off spatial consistency for extended temporal memory, combined with dense local attention to ensure coherence between consecutive frames. We evaluate the long-term memory capabilities of our model through spatial retrieval and reasoning tasks over extended horizons. Experiments on Memory Maze and Minecraft datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses baselines in preserving long-range memory, while maintaining practical inference speeds suitable for interactive applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Assessing the quality of long-form, model-generated text is challenging, even with advanced LLM-as-a-Judge methods, due to performance degradation as input length increases. To address this issue, we propose a divide-and-conquer approach, which breaks down the comprehensive evaluation task into a series of localized scoring tasks, followed by a final global assessment. This strategy allows for more granular and manageable evaluations, ensuring that each segment of the text is assessed in isolation for both coherence and quality, while also accounting for the overall structure and consistency of the entire piece. Moreover, we introduce a hybrid in-context learning approach that leverages human annotations to enhance the performance of both local and global evaluations. By incorporating human-generated feedback directly into the evaluation process, this method allows the model to better align with human judgment. Finally, we develop an uncertainty-based active learning algorithm that efficiently selects data samples for human annotation, thereby reducing annotation costs in practical scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed evaluation framework outperforms several representative baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances controllability in generative models by interpolating conditional and unconditional predictions. However, standard CFG often employs a static unconditional input, which can be suboptimal for iterative generation processes where model uncertainty varies dynamically. We introduce Adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance (A-CFG), a novel method that tailors the unconditional input by leveraging the model's instantaneous predictive confidence. At each step of an iterative (masked) diffusion language model, A-CFG identifies tokens in the currently generated sequence for which the model exhibits low confidence. These tokens are temporarily re-masked to create a dynamic, localized unconditional input. This focuses CFG's corrective influence precisely on areas of ambiguity, leading to more effective guidance. We integrate A-CFG into a state-of-the-art masked diffusion language model and demonstrate its efficacy. Experiments on diverse language generation benchmarks show that A-CFG yields substantial improvements over standard CFG, achieving, for instance, a 3.9 point gain on GPQA. Our work highlights the benefit of dynamically adapting guidance mechanisms to model uncertainty in iterative generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The emergence of pathology foundation models has revolutionized computational histopathology, enabling highly accurate, generalized whole-slide image analysis for improved cancer diagnosis, and prognosis assessment. While these models show remarkable potential across cancer diagnostics and prognostics, their clinical translation faces critical challenges including variability in optimal model across cancer types, potential data leakage in evaluation, and lack of standardized benchmarks. Without rigorous, unbiased evaluation, even the most advanced PFMs risk remaining confined to research settings, delaying their life-saving applications. Existing benchmarking efforts remain limited by narrow cancer-type focus, potential pretraining data overlaps, or incomplete task coverage. We present PathBench, the first comprehensive benchmark addressing these gaps through: multi-center in-hourse datasets spanning common cancers with rigorous leakage prevention, evaluation across the full clinical spectrum from diagnosis to prognosis, and an automated leaderboard system for continuous model assessment. Our framework incorporates large-scale data, enabling objective comparison of PFMs while reflecting real-world clinical complexity. All evaluation data comes from private medical providers, with strict exclusion of any pretraining usage to avoid data leakage risks. We have collected 15,888 WSIs from 8,549 patients across 10 hospitals, encompassing over 64 diagnosis and prognosis tasks. Currently, our evaluation of 19 PFMs shows that Virchow2 and H-Optimus-1 are the most effective models overall. This work provides researchers with a robust platform for model development and offers clinicians actionable insights into PFM performance across diverse clinical scenarios, ultimately accelerating the translation of these transformative technologies into routine pathology practice.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate and safe medication recommendations are critical for effective clinical decision-making, especially in multimorbidity cases. However, existing systems rely on point-wise prediction paradigms that overlook synergistic drug effects and potential adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs). We propose FLAME, a fine-grained list-wise alignment framework for large language models (LLMs), enabling drug-by-drug generation of drug lists. FLAME formulates recommendation as a sequential decision process, where each step adds or removes a single drug. To provide fine-grained learning signals, we devise step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with potential-based reward shaping, which explicitly models DDIs and optimizes the contribution of each drug to the overall prescription. Furthermore, FLAME enhances patient modeling by integrating structured clinical knowledge and collaborative information into the representation space of LLMs. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FLAME achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior accuracy, controllable safety-accuracy trade-offs, and strong generalization across diverse clinical scenarios.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal federated learning holds immense potential for collaboratively training models from multiple sources without sharing raw data, addressing both data scarcity and privacy concerns, two key challenges in healthcare. A major challenge in training multimodal federated models in healthcare is the presence of missing modalities due to multiple reasons, including variations in clinical practice, cost and accessibility constraints, retrospective data collection, privacy concerns, and occasional technical or human errors. Previous methods typically rely on publicly available real datasets or synthetic data to compensate for missing modalities. However, obtaining real datasets for every disease is impractical, and training generative models to synthesize missing modalities is computationally expensive and prone to errors due to the high dimensionality of medical data. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight, low-dimensional feature translator to reconstruct bottleneck features of the missing modalities. Our experiments on three different datasets (MIMIC-CXR, NIH Open-I, and CheXpert), in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings consistently improve the performance of competitive baselines.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly improved character animation techniques. However, current approaches rely on basic structural conditions such as DWPose or SMPL-X to animate character images, limiting their effectiveness in open-domain scenarios with dynamic backgrounds or challenging human poses. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{AniCrafter}$, a diffusion-based human-centric animation model that can seamlessly integrate and animate a given character into open-domain dynamic backgrounds while following given human motion sequences. Built on cutting-edge Image-to-Video (I2V) diffusion architectures, our model incorporates an innovative "avatar-background" conditioning mechanism that reframes open-domain human-centric animation as a restoration task, enabling more stable and versatile animation outputs. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method. Codes will be available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Long-horizon video-audio reasoning and fine-grained pixel understanding impose conflicting requirements on omnimodal models: dense temporal coverage demands many low-resolution frames, whereas precise grounding calls for high-resolution inputs. We tackle this trade-off with a two-system architecture: a Global Reasoning System selects informative keyframes and rewrites the task at low spatial cost, while a Detail Understanding System performs pixel-level grounding on the selected high-resolution snippets. Because ``optimal'' keyframe selection and reformulation are ambiguous and hard to supervise, we formulate them as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and present Omni-R1, an end-to-end RL framework built on Group Relative Policy Optimization. Omni-R1 trains the Global Reasoning System through hierarchical rewards obtained via online collaboration with the Detail Understanding System, requiring only one epoch of RL on small task splits. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, namely Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (RefAVS) and Reasoning Video Object Segmentation (REVOS), show that Omni-R1 not only surpasses strong supervised baselines but also outperforms specialized state-of-the-art models, while substantially improving out-of-domain generalization and mitigating multimodal hallucination. Our results demonstrate the first successful application of RL to large-scale omnimodal reasoning and highlight a scalable path toward universally foundation models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in diffusion models have enhanced multimodal-guided visual generation, enabling customized subject insertion that seamlessly "brushes" user-specified objects into a given image guided by textual prompts. However, existing methods often struggle to insert customized subjects with high fidelity and align results with the user's intent through textual prompts. In this work, we propose "In-Context Brush", a zero-shot framework for customized subject insertion by reformulating the task within the paradigm of in-context learning. Without loss of generality, we formulate the object image and the textual prompts as cross-modal demonstrations, and the target image with the masked region as the query. The goal is to inpaint the target image with the subject aligning textual prompts without model tuning. Building upon a pretrained MMDiT-based inpainting network, we perform test-time enhancement via dual-level latent space manipulation: intra-head "latent feature shifting" within each attention head that dynamically shifts attention outputs to reflect the desired subject semantics and inter-head "attention reweighting" across different heads that amplifies prompt controllability through differential attention prioritization. Extensive experiments and applications demonstrate that our approach achieves superior identity preservation, text alignment, and image quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without requiring dedicated training or additional data collection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in generative models have enabled high-fidelity text-to-image generation. However, open-source image-editing models still lag behind their proprietary counterparts, primarily due to limited high-quality data and insufficient benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ImgEdit, a large-scale, high-quality image-editing dataset comprising 1.2 million carefully curated edit pairs, which contain both novel and complex single-turn edits, as well as challenging multi-turn tasks. To ensure the data quality, we employ a multi-stage pipeline that integrates a cutting-edge vision-language model, a detection model, a segmentation model, alongside task-specific in-painting procedures and strict post-processing. ImgEdit surpasses existing datasets in both task novelty and data quality. Using ImgEdit, we train ImgEdit-E1, an editing model using Vision Language Model to process the reference image and editing prompt, which outperforms existing open-source models on multiple tasks, highlighting the value of ImgEdit and model design. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ImgEdit-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate image editing performance in terms of instruction adherence, editing quality, and detail preservation. It includes a basic testsuite, a challenging single-turn suite, and a dedicated multi-turn suite. We evaluate both open-source and proprietary models, as well as ImgEdit-E1, providing deep analysis and actionable insights into the current behavior of image-editing models.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) represent a classic paradigm where models enhance generative capabilities using external knowledge retrieved via a specialized module. Recent advancements in Agent techniques enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously utilize tools for retrieval, planning, and reasoning. While existing training-based methods show promise, their agentic abilities are limited by inherent characteristics of the task-specific data used during training. To further enhance the universal search capability of agents, we propose a novel pre-training framework, MASKSEARCH. In the pre-training stage, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Mask Prediction (RAMP) task, where the model learns to leverage search tools to fill masked spans on a large number of pre-training data, thus acquiring universal retrieval and reasoning capabilities for LLMs. After that, the model is trained on downstream tasks to achieve further improvement. We apply both Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for training. For SFT, we combine agent-based and distillation-based methods to generate training data, starting with a multi-agent system consisting of a planner, rewriter, observer, and followed by a self-evolving teacher model. While for RL, we employ DAPO as the training framework and adopt a hybrid reward system consisting of answer rewards and format rewards. Additionally, we introduce a curriculum learning approach that allows the model to learn progressively from easier to more challenging instances based on the number of masked spans. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework in the scenario of open-domain multi-hop question answering. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MASKSEARCH significantly enhances the performance of LLM-based search agents on both in-domain and out-of-domain downstream tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful generative paradigm for visual generation. The current de-facto standard of next token prediction commonly operates over a single-scale sequence of dense image tokens, and is incapable of utilizing global context especially for early tokens prediction. In this paper, we introduce a new autoregressive design to model a hierarchy from a few low-resolution image tokens to the typical dense image tokens, and delve into a thorough hierarchical dependency across multi-scale image tokens. Technically, we present a Hierarchical Masked Autoregressive models (Hi-MAR) that pivot on low-resolution image tokens to trigger hierarchical autoregressive modeling in a multi-phase manner. Hi-MAR learns to predict a few image tokens in low resolution, functioning as intermediary pivots to reflect global structure, in the first phase. Such pivots act as the additional guidance to strengthen the next autoregressive modeling phase by shaping global structural awareness of typical dense image tokens. A new Diffusion Transformer head is further devised to amplify the global context among all tokens for mask token prediction. Extensive evaluations on both class-conditional and text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that Hi-MAR outperforms typical AR baselines, while requiring fewer computational costs.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>An increasing number of autoregressive models, such as MAR, FlowAR, xAR, and Harmon adopt diffusion sampling to improve the quality of image generation. However, this strategy leads to low inference efficiency, because it usually takes 50 to 100 steps for diffusion to sample a token. This paper explores how to effectively address this issue. Our key motivation is that as more tokens are generated during the autoregressive process, subsequent tokens follow more constrained distributions and are easier to sample. To intuitively explain, if a model has generated part of a dog, the remaining tokens must complete the dog and thus are more constrained. Empirical evidence supports our motivation: at later generation stages, the next tokens can be well predicted by a multilayer perceptron, exhibit low variance, and follow closer-to-straight-line denoising paths from noise to tokens. Based on our finding, we introduce diffusion step annealing (DiSA), a training-free method which gradually uses fewer diffusion steps as more tokens are generated, e.g., using 50 steps at the beginning and gradually decreasing to 5 steps at later stages. Because DiSA is derived from our finding specific to diffusion in autoregressive models, it is complementary to existing acceleration methods designed for diffusion alone. DiSA can be implemented in only a few lines of code on existing models, and albeit simple, achieves $5-10\times$ faster inference for MAR and Harmon and $1.4-2.5\times$ for FlowAR and xAR, while maintaining the generation quality.</li>
