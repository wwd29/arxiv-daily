<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative pretrained transformers (GPT) are the common large language models (LLMs) used for generating text from natural language inputs. However, the fixed properties of language parameters in individual LLMs can lead to inconsistencies in the generated outputs. This limitation also restricts the models' ability to represent diverse language patterns due to inherent biases. Moreover, many powerful LLMs are closed-source. This prevents organizations from integrating their data into these systems, raising concerns about data privacy and limiting industry applications. Inspired by the successful application of LLM ensemble models in text generation, recent literature has also investigated their potential in code generation. This article reviews these emerging LLM ensemble approaches. Our goal is to enhance readers' understanding of existing techniques and encourage further research and practical implementation, aiming to expand the real-world applications of LLM ensemble models in both text and code generation. We categorize these approaches into seven main methods: weight merging, knowledge fusion, mixture of experts, reward ensemble, output ensemble, routing, and cascading. From this list, we focus on four methods and models that show strong performance and potential for broader applications. We analyze their modeling steps, training methods, and output features to provide a clear understanding of their capabilities. Our findings highlight the benefits of LLM ensemble techniques. These include better representation of diversity, improved output quality, and greater flexibility in applications. This information offers valuable insights for selecting models for various real-world tasks involving text and code generation, and potentially applying methods to multimodal LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Our analysis of the NeurIPS 2023 large language model (LLM) fine-tuning competition revealed the following trend: top-performing models exhibit significant overfitting on benchmark datasets, mirroring the broader issue of benchmark overfitting on popular leaderboards and that data curation is essential in order to get a high performing LLM. The competition, which consisted of two stages - an open evaluation stage with publicly available tasks and a closed evaluation stage with unseen tasks - allowed us to assess the generalizability of fine-tuned LLMs. Our results highlight the limitations of current benchmark-based evaluation schemes for generative models and demonstrate the need for more robust evaluation methods. Notably, the winning submissions utilized standard open-source libraries and focused primarily on data curation. To facilitate further research and promote reproducibility, we release all competition entries, Docker files, and evaluation infrastructure, providing a valuable resource for the community to explore fine-tuning, overfitting, and reproducibility in LLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmarks is frequently cited as proof of their medical capabilities. We hypothesized that LLM performance on medical MCQs may in part be illusory and driven by factors beyond medical content knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To assess this, we created a novel benchmark of free-response questions with paired MCQs (FreeMedQA). Using this benchmark, we evaluated three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, and LLama-3-70B-instruct) and found an average absolute deterioration of 39.43% in performance on free-response questions relative to multiple-choice (p = 1.3 * 10-5) which was greater than the human performance decline of 22.29%. To isolate the role of the MCQ format on performance, we performed a masking study, iteratively masking out parts of the question stem. At 100% masking, the average LLM multiple-choice performance was 6.70% greater than random chance (p = 0.002) with one LLM (GPT-4o) obtaining an accuracy of 37.34%. Notably, for all LLMs the free-response performance was near zero. Our results highlight the shortcomings in medical MCQ benchmarks for overestimating the capabilities of LLMs in medicine, and, broadly, the potential for improving both human and machine assessments using LLM-evaluated free-response questions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scientific problem-solving involves synthesizing information while applying expert knowledge. We introduce CURIE, a scientific long-Context Understanding,Reasoning and Information Extraction benchmark to measure the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in scientific problem-solving and assisting scientists in realistic workflows. This benchmark introduces ten challenging tasks with a total of 580 problems and solution pairs curated by experts in six disciplines - materials science, condensed matter physics, quantum computing, geospatial analysis, biodiversity, and proteins - covering both experimental and theoretical work-flows in science. We evaluate a range of closed and open LLMs on tasks in CURIE which requires domain expertise, comprehension of long in-context information,and multi-step reasoning. While Gemini Flash 2.0 and Claude-3 show consistent high comprehension across domains, the popular GPT-4o and command-R+ fail dramatically on protein sequencing tasks. With the best performance at 32% there is much room for improvement for all models. We hope that insights gained from CURIE can guide the future development of LLMs in sciences.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rise of multimodal generative AI is transforming the intersection of technology and art, offering deeper insights into large-scale artwork. Although its creative capabilities have been widely explored, its potential to represent artwork in latent spaces remains underexamined. We use cutting-edge generative AI, specifically Stable Diffusion, to analyze 500 years of Western paintings by extracting two types of latent information with the model: formal aspects (e.g., colors) and contextual aspects (e.g., subject). Our findings reveal that contextual information differentiates between artistic periods, styles, and individual artists more successfully than formal elements. Additionally, using contextual keywords extracted from paintings, we show how artistic expression evolves alongside societal changes. Our generative experiment, infusing prospective contexts into historical artworks, successfully reproduces the evolutionary trajectory of artworks, highlighting the significance of mutual interaction between society and art. This study demonstrates how multimodal AI expands traditional formal analysis by integrating temporal, cultural, and historical contexts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Cross-dataset Human Activity Recognition (HAR) suffers from limited model generalization, hindering its practical deployment. To address this critical challenge, inspired by the success of DoReMi in Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a data mixture optimization strategy for pre-training HAR models, aiming to improve the recognition performance across heterogeneous datasets. However, directly applying DoReMi to the HAR field encounters new challenges due to the continuous, multi-channel and intrinsic heterogeneous characteristics of IMU sensor data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework HAR-DoReMi, which introduces a masked reconstruction task based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss. By raplacing the discrete language sequence prediction task, which relies on the Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) loss, in the original DoReMi framework, the proposed framework is inherently more appropriate for handling the continuous and multi-channel characteristics of IMU data. In addition, HAR-DoReMi integrates the Mahony fusion algorithm into the self-supervised HAR pre-training, aiming to mitigate the heterogeneity of varying sensor orientation. This is achieved by estimating the sensor orientation within each dataset and facilitating alignment with a unified coordinate system, thereby improving the cross-dataset generalization ability of the HAR model. Experimental evaluation on multiple cross-dataset HAR transfer tasks demonstrates that HAR-DoReMi improves the accuracy by an average of 6.51%, compared to the current state-of-the-art method with only approximately 30% to 50% of the data usage. These results confirm the effectiveness of HAR-DoReMi in improving the generalization and data efficiency of pre-training HAR models, underscoring its significant potential to facilitate the practical deployment of HAR technology.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This study introduces a cutting-edge regional weather forecasting model based on the SwinTransformer 3D architecture. This model is specifically designed to deliver precise hourly weather predictions ranging from 1 hour to 5 days, significantly improving the reliability and practicality of short-term weather forecasts. Our model has demonstrated generally superior performance when compared to Pangu, a well-established global model. The evaluation indicates that our model excels in predicting most weather variables, highlighting its potential as a more effective alternative in the field of limited area modeling. A noteworthy feature of this model is the integration of enhanced boundary conditions, inspired by traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) techniques. This integration has substantially improved the model's predictive accuracy. Additionally, the model includes an innovative approach for diagnosing hourly total precipitation at a high spatial resolution of approximately 5 kilometers. This is achieved through a latent diffusion model, offering an alternative method for generating high-resolution precipitation data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Electrocardiogram data, one of the most widely available biosignal data, has become increasingly valuable with the emergence of deep learning methods, providing novel insights into cardiovascular diseases and broader health conditions. However, heterogeneity of electrocardiogram formats, limited access to deep learning model weights and intricate algorithmic steps for effective fine-tuning for own disease target labels result in complex workflows. In this work, we introduce ExChanGeAI, a web-based end-to-end platform that streamlines the reading of different formats, pre-processing, visualization and custom machine learning with local and privacy-preserving fine-tuning. ExChanGeAI is adaptable for use on both personal computers and scalable to high performance server environments. The platform offers state-of-the-art deep learning models for training from scratch, alongside our novel open-source electrocardiogram foundation model CardX, pre-trained on over one million electrocardiograms. Evaluation across three external validation sets, including an entirely new testset extracted from routine care, demonstrate the fine-tuning capabilities of ExChanGeAI. CardX outperformed the benchmark foundation model while requiring significantly fewer parameters and lower computational resources.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant advancements in generating high-quality, diverse images from text prompts. However, the inherent limitations of textual signals often prevent these models from fully capturing specific concepts, thereby reducing their controllability. To address this issue, several approaches have incorporated personalization techniques, utilizing reference images to mine visual concept representations that complement textual inputs and enhance the controllability of text-to-image diffusion models. Despite these advances, a comprehensive, systematic exploration of visual concept mining remains limited. In this paper, we categorize existing research into four key areas: Concept Learning, Concept Erasing, Concept Decomposition, and Concept Combination. This classification provides valuable insights into the foundational principles of Visual Concept Mining (VCM) techniques. Additionally, we identify key challenges and propose future research directions to propel this important and interesting field forward.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Single Domain Generalization (SDG) aims to train models with consistent performance across diverse scenarios using data from a single source. While using latent diffusion models (LDMs) show promise in augmenting limited source data, we demonstrate that directly using synthetic data can be detrimental due to significant feature distribution discrepancies between synthetic and real target domains, leading to performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose Discriminative Domain Reassembly and Soft-Fusion (DRSF), a training framework leveraging synthetic data to improve model generalization. We employ LDMs to produce diverse pseudo-target domain samples and introduce two key modules to handle distribution bias. First, Discriminative Feature Decoupling and Reassembly (DFDR) module uses entropy-guided attention to recalibrate channel-level features, suppressing synthetic noise while preserving semantic consistency. Second, Multi-pseudo-domain Soft Fusion (MDSF) module uses adversarial training with latent-space feature interpolation, creating continuous feature transitions between domains. Extensive SDG experiments on object detection and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that DRSF achieves substantial performance gains with only marginal computational overhead. Notably, DRSF's plug-and-play architecture enables seamless integration with unsupervised domain adaptation paradigms, underscoring its broad applicability in addressing diverse and real-world domain challenges.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Numerous text-to-video (T2V) editing methods have emerged recently, but the lack of a standardized benchmark for fair evaluation has led to inconsistent claims and an inability to assess model sensitivity to hyperparameters. Fine-grained video editing is crucial for enabling precise, object-level modifications while maintaining context and temporal consistency. To address this, we introduce FiVE, a Fine-grained Video Editing Benchmark for evaluating emerging diffusion and rectified flow models. Our benchmark includes 74 real-world videos and 26 generated videos, featuring 6 fine-grained editing types, 420 object-level editing prompt pairs, and their corresponding masks. Additionally, we adapt the latest rectified flow (RF) T2V generation models, Pyramid-Flow and Wan2.1, by introducing FlowEdit, resulting in training-free and inversion-free video editing models Pyramid-Edit and Wan-Edit. We evaluate five diffusion-based and two RF-based editing methods on our FiVE benchmark using 15 metrics, covering background preservation, text-video similarity, temporal consistency, video quality, and runtime. To further enhance object-level evaluation, we introduce FiVE-Acc, a novel metric leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to assess the success of fine-grained video editing. Experimental results demonstrate that RF-based editing significantly outperforms diffusion-based methods, with Wan-Edit achieving the best overall performance and exhibiting the least sensitivity to hyperparameters.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural operators have emerged as powerful surrogates for modeling complex physical problems. However, they suffer from spectral bias making them oblivious to high-frequency modes, which are present in multiscale physical systems. Therefore, they tend to produce over-smoothed solutions, which is particularly problematic in modeling turbulence and for systems with intricate patterns and sharp gradients such as multi-phase flow systems. In this work, we introduce a new approach named high-frequency scaling (HFS) to mitigate spectral bias in convolutional-based neural operators. By integrating HFS with proper variants of UNet neural operators, we demonstrate a higher prediction accuracy by mitigating spectral bias in single and two-phase flow problems. Unlike Fourier-based techniques, HFS is directly applied to the latent space, thus eliminating the computational cost associated with the Fourier transform. Additionally, we investigate alternative spectral bias mitigation through diffusion models conditioned on neural operators. While the diffusion model integrated with the standard neural operator may still suffer from significant errors, these errors are substantially reduced when the diffusion model is integrated with a HFS-enhanced neural operator.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recently, patch-deformation methods have exhibited significant effectiveness in multi-view stereo owing to the deformable and expandable patches in reconstructing textureless areas. However, such methods primarily emphasize broadening the receptive field in textureless areas, while neglecting deformation instability caused by easily overlooked edge-skipping, potentially leading to matching distortions. To address this, we propose SED-MVS, which adopts panoptic segmentation and multi-trajectory diffusion strategy for segmentation-driven and edge-aligned patch deformation. Specifically, to prevent unanticipated edge-skipping, we first employ SAM2 for panoptic segmentation as depth-edge guidance to guide patch deformation, followed by multi-trajectory diffusion strategy to ensure patches are comprehensively aligned with depth edges. Moreover, to avoid potential inaccuracy of random initialization, we combine both sparse points from LoFTR and monocular depth map from DepthAnything V2 to restore reliable and realistic depth map for initialization and supervised guidance. Finally, we integrate segmentation image with monocular depth map to exploit inter-instance occlusion relationship, then further regard them as occlusion map to implement two distinct edge constraint, thereby facilitating occlusion-aware patch deformation. Extensive results on ETH3D, Tanks & Temples, BlendedMVS and Strecha datasets validate the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capability of our proposed method.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating images with embedded text is crucial for the automatic production of visual and multimodal documents, such as educational materials and advertisements. However, existing diffusion-based text-to-image models often struggle to accurately embed text within images, facing challenges in spelling accuracy, contextual relevance, and visual coherence. Evaluating the ability of such models to embed text within a generated image is complicated due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. In this work, we introduce TextInVision, a large-scale, text and prompt complexity driven benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of diffusion models to effectively integrate visual text into images. We crafted a diverse set of prompts and texts that consider various attributes and text characteristics. Additionally, we prepared an image dataset to test Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models across different character representations, highlighting that VAE architectures can also pose challenges in text generation within diffusion frameworks. Through extensive analysis of multiple models, we identify common errors and highlight issues such as spelling inaccuracies and contextual mismatches. By pinpointing the failure points across different prompts and texts, our research lays the foundation for future advancements in AI-generated multimodal content.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-view person association is a fundamental step towards multi-view analysis of human activities. Although the person re-identification features have been proven effective, they become unreliable in challenging scenes where persons share similar appearances. Therefore, cross-view geometric constraints are required for a more robust association. However, most existing approaches are either fully-supervised using ground-truth identity labels or require calibrated camera parameters that are hard to obtain. In this work, we investigate the potential of learning from synchronization, and propose a self-supervised uncalibrated multi-view person association approach, Self-MVA, without using any annotations. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised learning framework, consisting of an encoder-decoder model and a self-supervised pretext task, cross-view image synchronization, which aims to distinguish whether two images from different views are captured at the same time. The model encodes each person's unified geometric and appearance features, and we train it by utilizing synchronization labels for supervision after applying Hungarian matching to bridge the gap between instance-wise and image-wise distances. To further reduce the solution space, we propose two types of self-supervised linear constraints: multi-view re-projection and pairwise edge association. Extensive experiments on three challenging public benchmark datasets (WILDTRACK, MVOR, and SOLDIERS) show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing existing unsupervised and fully-supervised approaches.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>How can we effectively unlearn selected concepts from pre-trained generative foundation models without resorting to extensive retraining? This research introduces `continual unlearning', a novel paradigm that enables the targeted removal of multiple specific concepts from foundational generative models, incrementally. We propose Decremental Unlearning without Generalization Erosion (DUGE) algorithm which selectively unlearns the generation of undesired concepts while preserving the generation of related, non-targeted concepts and alleviating generalization erosion. For this, DUGE targets three losses: a cross-attention loss that steers the focus towards images devoid of the target concept; a prior-preservation loss that safeguards knowledge related to non-target concepts; and a regularization loss that prevents the model from suffering from generalization erosion. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to exclude certain concepts without compromising the overall integrity and performance of the model. This offers a pragmatic solution for refining generative models, adeptly handling the intricacies of model training and concept management lowering the risks of copyright infringement, personal or licensed material misuse, and replication of distinctive artistic styles. Importantly, it maintains the non-targeted concepts, thereby safeguarding the model's core capabilities and effectiveness.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large foundation models trained on large-scale visual-text data can significantly enhance Open Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) through data generation. However, this may lead to biased synthetic data and overfitting to specific configurations. It can sidestep biases of manually curated data generation by directly leveraging hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs), which is surprisingly rarely explored. This paper presents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder layers of the LLM of a MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention adapter to enable efficient knowledge transfer from LLMs to object detectors, an new approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We demonstrate that intermediate hidden states from early LLM layers retain strong spatial-semantic correlations that are beneficial to grounding tasks. Experiments show that our adaptation strategy significantly enhances the performance on complex free-form text queries while remaining the same on plain categories. With our adaptation, Qwen2-0.5B with Swin-T as the vision encoder improves GroundingDINO by 2.33% on Omnilabel, at the overhead of 8.7% more GFLOPs. Qwen2-0.5B with a larger vision encoder can further boost the performance by 6.22%. We further validate our design by ablating on varied adapter architectures, sizes of LLMs, and which layers to add adaptation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Ensuring robustness in image watermarking is crucial for and maintaining content integrity under diverse transformations. Recent self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches, such as DINO, have been leveraged for watermarking but primarily focus on general feature representation rather than explicitly learning invariant features. In this work, we propose a novel text-guided invariant feature learning framework for robust image watermarking. Our approach leverages CLIP's multimodal capabilities, using text embeddings as stable semantic anchors to enforce feature invariance under distortions. We evaluate the proposed method across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior robustness against various image transformations. Compared to state-of-the-art SSL methods, our model achieves higher cosine similarity in feature consistency tests and outperforms existing watermarking schemes in extraction accuracy under severe distortions. These results highlight the efficacy of our method in learning invariant representations tailored for robust deep learning-based watermarking.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>World models significantly enhance hierarchical understanding, improving data integration and learning efficiency. To explore the potential of the world model in the remote sensing (RS) field, this paper proposes a label-efficient remote sensing world model for multimodal data fusion (FusDreamer). The FusDreamer uses the world model as a unified representation container to abstract common and high-level knowledge, promoting interactions across different types of data, \emph{i.e.}, hyperspectral (HSI), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and text data. Initially, a new latent diffusion fusion and multimodal generation paradigm (LaMG) is utilized for its exceptional information integration and detail retention capabilities. Subsequently, an open-world knowledge-guided consistency projection (OK-CP) module incorporates prompt representations for visually described objects and aligns language-visual features through contrastive learning. In this way, the domain gap can be bridged by fine-tuning the pre-trained world models with limited samples. Finally, an end-to-end multitask combinatorial optimization (MuCO) strategy can capture slight feature bias and constrain the diffusion process in a collaboratively learnable direction. Experiments conducted on four typical datasets indicate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed FusDreamer. The corresponding code will be released at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce a novel diffusion-based approach for generating privacy-preserving digital twins of multi-room indoor environments from depth images only. Central to our approach is a novel Multi-view Overlapped Scene Alignment with Implicit Consistency (MOSAIC) model that explicitly considers cross-view dependencies within the same scene in the probabilistic sense. MOSAIC operates through a novel inference-time optimization that avoids error accumulation common in sequential or single-room constraint in panorama-based approaches. MOSAIC scales to complex scenes with zero extra training and provably reduces the variance during denoising processes when more overlapping views are added, leading to improved generation quality. Experiments show that MOSAIC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on image fidelity metrics in reconstructing complex multi-room environments. Project page is available at: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, generative, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised anomaly detection using deep learning has garnered significant research attention due to its broad applicability, particularly in medical imaging where labeled anomalous data are scarce. While earlier approaches leverage generative models like autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs), they often fall short due to overgeneralization. Recent methods explore various strategies, including memory banks, normalizing flows, self-supervised learning, and knowledge distillation, to enhance discrimination. Among these, knowledge distillation, particularly reverse distillation, has shown promise. Following this paradigm, we propose a novel scale-aware contrastive reverse distillation model that addresses two key limitations of existing reverse distillation methods: insufficient feature discriminability and inability to handle anomaly scale variations. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive student-teacher learning approach to derive more discriminative representations by generating and exploring out-of-normal distributions. Further, we design a scale adaptation mechanism to softly weight contrastive distillation losses at different scales to account for the scale variation issue. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the efficacy of the proposed method. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-driven motion generation has advanced significantly with the rise of denoising diffusion models. However, previous methods often oversimplify representations for the skeletal joints, temporal frames, and textual words, limiting their ability to fully capture the information within each modality and their interactions. Moreover, when using pre-trained models for downstream tasks, such as editing, they typically require additional efforts, including manual interventions, optimization, or fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce a skeleton-aware latent diffusion (SALAD), a model that explicitly captures the intricate inter-relationships between joints, frames, and words. Furthermore, by leveraging cross-attention maps produced during the generation process, we enable attention-based zero-shot text-driven motion editing using a pre-trained SALAD model, requiring no additional user input beyond text prompts. Our approach significantly outperforms previous methods in terms of text-motion alignment without compromising generation quality, and demonstrates practical versatility by providing diverse editing capabilities beyond generation.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in motion diffusion models have led to remarkable progress in diverse motion generation tasks, including text-to-motion synthesis. However, existing approaches represent motions as dense frame sequences, requiring the model to process redundant or less informative frames. The processing of dense animation frames imposes significant training complexity, especially when learning intricate distributions of large motion datasets even with modern neural architectures. This severely limits the performance of generative motion models for downstream tasks. Inspired by professional animators who mainly focus on sparse keyframes, we propose a novel diffusion framework explicitly designed around sparse and geometrically meaningful keyframes. Our method reduces computation by masking non-keyframes and efficiently interpolating missing frames. We dynamically refine the keyframe mask during inference to prioritize informative frames in later diffusion steps. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in text alignment and motion realism, while also effectively maintaining high performance at significantly fewer diffusion steps. We further validate the robustness of our framework by using it as a generative prior and adapting it to different downstream tasks. Source code and pre-trained models will be released upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) are composed of multiple types of nodes and edges, making it more effective in capturing the complex relational structures inherent in the real world. However, in real-world scenarios, labeled data is often difficult to obtain, which limits the applicability of semi-supervised approaches. Self-supervised learning aims to enable models to automatically learn useful features from data, effectively addressing the challenge of limited labeling data. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework for heterogeneous graphs (ASHGCL), which incorporates three distinct views, each focusing on node attributes, high-order and low-order structural information, respectively, to effectively capture attribute information, high-order structures, and low-order structures for node representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce an attribute-enhanced positive sample selection strategy that combines both structural information and attribute information, effectively addressing the issue of sampling bias. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that ASHGCL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised baselines and even surpasses some supervised benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning (SSL) on 3D point clouds has the potential to learn feature representations that can transfer to diverse sensors and multiple downstream perception tasks. However, recent SSL approaches fail to define pretext tasks that retain geometric information such as object pose and scale, which can be detrimental to the performance of downstream localization and geometry-sensitive 3D scene understanding tasks, such as 3D semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We propose PSA-SSL, a novel extension to point cloud SSL that learns object pose and size-aware (PSA) features. Our approach defines a self-supervised bounding box regression pretext task, which retains object pose and size information. Furthermore, we incorporate LiDAR beam pattern augmentation on input point clouds, which encourages learning sensor-agnostic features. Our experiments demonstrate that with a single pretrained model, our light-weight yet effective extensions achieve significant improvements on 3D semantic segmentation with limited labels across popular autonomous driving datasets (Waymo, nuScenes, SemanticKITTI). Moreover, our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art SSL methods on 3D semantic segmentation (using up to 10 times less labels), as well as on 3D object detection.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) have been one of the most important discoveries in machine learning in recent years. LLM-based artificial intelligence (AI) assistants, such as ChatGPT, have consistently attracted the attention from researchers, investors, and the general public, driving the rapid growth of this industry. With the frequent introduction of new LLMs to the market, it becomes increasingly difficult to differentiate between them, creating a demand for new LLM comparison methods. In this research, the Consistency-focused Similarity Comparison Framework (ConSCompF) for generative large language models is proposed. It compares texts generated by two LLMs and produces a similarity score, indicating the overall degree of similarity between their responses. The main advantage of this framework is that it can operate on a small number of unlabeled data, such as chatbot instruction prompts, and does not require LLM developers to disclose any information about their product. To evaluate the efficacy of ConSCompF, two experiments aimed at identifying similarities between multiple LLMs are conducted. Additionally, these experiments examine the correlation between the similarity scores generated by ConSCompF and the differences in the outputs produced by other benchmarking techniques, such as ROUGE-L. Finally, a series of few-shot LLM comparison experiments is conducted to evaluate the performance of ConSCompF in a few-shot LLM comparison scenario. The proposed framework can be used for calculating similarity matrices of multiple LLMs, which can be effectively visualized using principal component analysis (PCA). The ConSCompF output may provide useful insights into data that might have been used during LLM training and help detect possible investment fraud attempts.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic communication is emerging as a promising paradigm that focuses on the extraction and transmission of semantic meanings using deep learning techniques. While current research primarily addresses the reduction of semantic communication overhead, it often overlooks the training phase, which can incur significant communication costs in dynamic wireless environments. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-modal semantic communication system that leverages multi-modal self-supervised learning to enhance task-agnostic feature extraction. The proposed approach employs self-supervised learning during the pre-training phase to extract task-agnostic semantic features, followed by supervised fine-tuning for downstream tasks. This dual-phase strategy effectively captures both modality-invariant and modality-specific features while minimizing training-related communication overhead. Experimental results on the NYU Depth V2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces training-related communication overhead while maintaining or exceeding the performance of existing supervised learning approaches. The findings underscore the advantages of multi-modal self-supervised learning in semantic communication, paving the way for more efficient and scalable edge inference systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The fine-tuning technique for text-to-image diffusion models facilitates image customization but risks privacy breaches and opinion manipulation. Current research focuses on prompt- or image-level adversarial attacks for anti-customization, yet it overlooks the correlation between these two levels and the relationship between internal modules and inputs. This hinders anti-customization performance in practical threat scenarios. We propose Dual Anti-Diffusion (DADiff), a two-stage adversarial attack targeting diffusion customization, which, for the first time, integrates the adversarial prompt-level attack into the generation process of image-level adversarial examples. In stage 1, we generate prompt-level adversarial vectors to guide the subsequent image-level attack. In stage 2, besides conducting the end-to-end attack on the UNet model, we disrupt its self- and cross-attention modules, aiming to break the correlations between image pixels and align the cross-attention results computed using instance prompts and adversarial prompt vectors within the images. Furthermore, we introduce a local random timestep gradient ensemble strategy, which updates adversarial perturbations by integrating random gradients from multiple segmented timesets. Experimental results on various mainstream facial datasets demonstrate 10%-30% improvements in cross-prompt, keyword mismatch, cross-model, and cross-mechanism anti-customization with DADiff compared to existing methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, a lack of data has become a major obstacle to enhancing perception model accuracy. Researchers are now exploring controllable data generation using world models to diversify datasets. However, previous work has been limited to studying image generation quality on specific public datasets. There is still relatively little research on how to build data generation engines for real-world application scenes to achieve large-scale data generation for challenging scenes. In this paper, a simulator-conditioned scene generation engine based on world model is proposed. By constructing a simulation system consistent with real-world scenes, simulation data and labels, which serve as the conditions for data generation in the world model, for any scenes can be collected. It is a novel data generation pipeline by combining the powerful scene simulation capabilities of the simulation engine with the robust data generation capabilities of the world model. In addition, a benchmark with proportionally constructed virtual and real data, is provided for exploring the capabilities of world models in real-world scenes. Quantitative results show that these generated images significantly improve downstream perception models performance. Finally, we explored the generative performance of the world model in urban autonomous driving scenarios. All the data and code will be available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Top-leading solutions for Video Scene Graph Generation (VSGG) typically adopt an offline pipeline. Though demonstrating promising performance, they remain unable to handle real-time video streams and consume large GPU memory. Moreover, these approaches fall short in temporal reasoning, merely aggregating frame-level predictions over a temporal context. In response, we introduce DIFFVSGG, an online VSGG solution that frames this task as an iterative scene graph update problem. Drawing inspiration from Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) which generate images via denoising a latent feature embedding, we unify the decoding of object classification, bounding box regression, and graph generation three tasks using one shared feature embedding. Then, given an embedding containing unified features of object pairs, we conduct a step-wise Denoising on it within LDMs, so as to deliver a clean embedding which clearly indicates the relationships between objects. This embedding then serves as the input to task-specific heads for object classification, scene graph generation, etc. DIFFVSGG further facilitates continuous temporal reasoning, where predictions for subsequent frames leverage results of past frames as the conditional inputs of LDMs, to guide the reverse diffusion process for current frames. Extensive experiments on three setups of Action Genome demonstrate the superiority of DIFFVSGG.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Developing effective visual inspection models remains challenging due to the scarcity of defect data. While image generation models have been used to synthesize defect images, producing highly realistic defects remains difficult. We propose DefectFill, a novel method for realistic defect generation that requires only a few reference defect images. It leverages a fine-tuned inpainting diffusion model, optimized with our custom loss functions incorporating defect, object, and attention terms. It enables precise capture of detailed, localized defect features and their seamless integration into defect-free objects. Additionally, our Low-Fidelity Selection method further enhances the defect sample quality. Experiments show that DefectFill generates high-quality defect images, enabling visual inspection models to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MVTec AD dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models have recently made remarkable progress in the field of 3D objects. However, their practical application in fields like engineering remains limited since they fail to deliver the accuracy, quality, and controllability needed for domain-specific tasks. Fine-tuning large generative models is a promising perspective for making these models available in these fields. Creating high-quality, domain-specific 3D datasets is crucial for fine-tuning large generative models, yet the data filtering and annotation process remains a significant bottleneck. We present MeshFleet, a filtered and annotated 3D vehicle dataset extracted from Objaverse-XL, the most extensive publicly available collection of 3D objects. Our approach proposes a pipeline for automated data filtering based on a quality classifier. This classifier is trained on a manually labeled subset of Objaverse, incorporating DINOv2 and SigLIP embeddings, refined through caption-based analysis and uncertainty estimation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our filtering method through a comparative analysis against caption and image aesthetic score-based techniques and fine-tuning experiments with SV3D, highlighting the importance of targeted data selection for domain-specific 3D generative modeling.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose Intra and Inter Parser-Prompted Transformers (PPTformer) that explore useful features from visual foundation models for image restoration. Specifically, PPTformer contains two parts: an Image Restoration Network (IRNet) for restoring images from degraded observations and a Parser-Prompted Feature Generation Network (PPFGNet) for providing IRNet with reliable parser information to boost restoration. To enhance the integration of the parser within IRNet, we propose Intra Parser-Prompted Attention (IntraPPA) and Inter Parser-Prompted Attention (InterPPA) to implicitly and explicitly learn useful parser features to facilitate restoration. The IntraPPA re-considers cross attention between parser and restoration features, enabling implicit perception of the parser from a long-range and intra-layer perspective. Conversely, the InterPPA initially fuses restoration features with those of the parser, followed by formulating these fused features within an attention mechanism to explicitly perceive parser information. Further, we propose a parser-prompted feed-forward network to guide restoration within pixel-wise gating modulation. Experimental results show that PPTformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on image deraining, defocus deblurring, desnowing, and low-light enhancement.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Autoregressive Transformer models have demonstrated impressive performance in video generation, but their sequential token-by-token decoding process poses a major bottleneck, particularly for long videos represented by tens of thousands of tokens. In this paper, we propose Diagonal Decoding (DiagD), a training-free inference acceleration algorithm for autoregressively pre-trained models that exploits spatial and temporal correlations in videos. Our method generates tokens along diagonal paths in the spatial-temporal token grid, enabling parallel decoding within each frame as well as partially overlapping across consecutive frames. The proposed algorithm is versatile and adaptive to various generative models and tasks, while providing flexible control over the trade-off between inference speed and visual quality. Furthermore, we propose a cost-effective finetuning strategy that aligns the attention patterns of the model with our decoding order, further mitigating the training-inference gap on small-scale models. Experiments on multiple autoregressive video generation models and datasets demonstrate that DiagD achieves up to $10\times$ speedup compared to naive sequential decoding, while maintaining comparable visual fidelity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies suggest utilizing generative models instead of traditional auto-regressive algorithms for time series forecasting (TSF) tasks. These non-auto-regressive approaches involving different generative methods, including GAN, Diffusion, and Flow Matching for time series, have empirically demonstrated high-quality generation capability and accuracy. However, we still lack an appropriate understanding of how it processes approximation and generalization. This paper presents the first theoretical framework from the perspective of flow-based generative models to relieve the knowledge of limitations. In particular, we provide our insights with strict guarantees from three perspectives: $\textbf{Approximation}$, $\textbf{Generalization}$ and $\textbf{Efficiency}$. In detail, our analysis achieves the contributions as follows: $\bullet$ By assuming a general data model, the fitting of the flow-based generative models is confirmed to converge to arbitrary error under the universal approximation of Diffusion Transformer (DiT). $\bullet$ Introducing a polynomial-based regularization for flow matching, the generalization error thus be bounded since the generalization of polynomial approximation. $\bullet$ The sampling for generation is considered as an optimization process, we demonstrate its fast convergence with updating standard first-order gradient descent of some objective.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work presents the first condensation approach for procedural video datasets used in temporal action segmentation. We propose a condensation framework that leverages generative prior learned from the dataset and network inversion to condense data into compact latent codes with significant storage reduced across temporal and channel aspects. Orthogonally, we propose sampling diverse and representative action sequences to minimize video-wise redundancy. Our evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates consistent effectiveness in condensing TAS datasets and achieving competitive performances. Specifically, on the Breakfast dataset, our approach reduces storage by over 500$\times$ while retaining 83% of the performance compared to training with the full dataset. Furthermore, when applied to a downstream incremental learning task, it yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While foundation models have revolutionised computer vision, their effectiveness for sketch understanding remains limited by the unique challenges of abstract, sparse visual inputs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover two fundamental limitations: Stable Diffusion (SD) struggles to extract meaningful features from abstract sketches (unlike its success with photos), and exhibits a pronounced frequency-domain bias that suppresses essential low-frequency components needed for sketch understanding. Rather than costly retraining, we address these limitations by strategically combining SD with CLIP, whose strong semantic understanding naturally compensates for SD's spatial-frequency biases. By dynamically injecting CLIP features into SD's denoising process and adaptively aggregating features across semantic levels, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in sketch retrieval (+3.35%), recognition (+1.06%), segmentation (+29.42%), and correspondence learning (+21.22%), demonstrating the first truly universal sketch feature representation in the era of foundation models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Decision trees are a crucial class of models offering robust predictive performance and inherent interpretability across various domains, including healthcare, finance, and logistics. However, current tree induction methods often face limitations such as suboptimal solutions from greedy methods or prohibitive computational costs and limited applicability of exact optimization approaches. To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary optimization method for decision tree induction based on genetic programming (GP). Our key innovation is the integration of semantic priors and domain-specific knowledge about the search space into the optimization algorithm. To this end, we introduce $\texttt{LLEGO}$, a framework that incorporates semantic priors into genetic search operators through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), thereby enhancing search efficiency and targeting regions of the search space that yield decision trees with superior generalization performance. This is operationalized through novel genetic operators that work with structured natural language prompts, effectively utilizing LLMs as conditional generative models and sources of semantic knowledge. Specifically, we introduce $\textit{fitness-guided}$ crossover to exploit high-performing regions, and $\textit{diversity-guided}$ mutation for efficient global exploration of the search space. These operators are controlled by corresponding hyperparameters that enable a more nuanced balance between exploration and exploitation across the search space. Empirically, we demonstrate across various benchmarks that $\texttt{LLEGO}$ evolves superior-performing trees compared to existing tree induction methods, and exhibits significantly more efficient search performance compared to conventional GP approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-Image diffusion models can produce undesirable content that necessitates concept erasure techniques. However, existing methods struggle with under-erasure, leaving residual traces of targeted concepts, or over-erasure, mistakenly eliminating unrelated but visually similar concepts. To address these limitations, we introduce CRCE, a novel concept erasure framework that leverages Large Language Models to identify both semantically related concepts that should be erased alongside the target and distinct concepts that should be preserved. By explicitly modeling coreferential and retained concepts semantically, CRCE enables more precise concept removal, without unintended erasure. Experiments demonstrate that CRCE outperforms existing methods on diverse erasure tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces JuDGE (Judgment Document Generation Evaluation), a novel benchmark for evaluating the performance of judgment document generation in the Chinese legal system. We define the task as generating a complete legal judgment document from the given factual description of the case. To facilitate this benchmark, we construct a comprehensive dataset consisting of factual descriptions from real legal cases, paired with their corresponding full judgment documents, which serve as the ground truth for evaluating the quality of generated documents. This dataset is further augmented by two external legal corpora that provide additional legal knowledge for the task: one comprising statutes and regulations, and the other consisting of a large collection of past judgment documents. In collaboration with legal professionals, we establish a comprehensive automated evaluation framework to assess the quality of generated judgment documents across various dimensions. We evaluate various baseline approaches, including few-shot in-context learning, fine-tuning, and a multi-source retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach, using both general and legal-domain LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that, while RAG approaches can effectively improve performance in this task, there is still substantial room for further improvement.

This simplifies the imitation learning pipeline while achieving state-of-the-art performance on a variety of popular simulated robotics tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Real-world image super-resolution is a critical image processing task, where two key evaluation criteria are the fidelity to the original image and the visual realness of the generated results. Although existing methods based on diffusion models excel in visual realness by leveraging strong priors, they often struggle to achieve an effective balance between fidelity and realness. In our preliminary experiments, we observe that a linear combination of multiple models outperforms individual models, motivating us to harness the strengths of different models for a more effective trade-off. Based on this insight, we propose a distillation-based approach that leverages the geometric decomposition of both fidelity and realness, alongside the performance advantages of multiple teacher models, to strike a more balanced trade-off. Furthermore, we explore the controllability of this trade-off, enabling a flexible and adjustable super-resolution process, which we call CTSR (Controllable Trade-off Super-Resolution). Experiments conducted on several real-world image super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance across both fidelity and realness metrics.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have transformed image generation, enabling significant progress in stylized generation using only a few style reference images. However, current diffusion-based methods struggle with fine-grained style customization due to challenges in controlling multiple style attributes, such as color and texture. This paper introduces the first tuning-free approach to achieve free-lunch color-texture disentanglement in stylized T2I generation, addressing the need for independently controlled style elements for the Disentangled Stylized Image Generation (DisIG) problem. Our approach leverages the Image-Prompt Additivity property in the CLIP image embedding space to develop techniques for separating and extracting Color-Texture Embeddings (CTE) from individual color and texture reference images. To ensure that the color palette of the generated image aligns closely with the color reference, we apply a whitening and coloring transformation to enhance color consistency. Additionally, to prevent texture loss due to the signal-leak bias inherent in diffusion training, we introduce a noise term that preserves textural fidelity during the Regularized Whitening and Coloring Transformation (RegWCT). Through these methods, our Style Attributes Disentanglement approach (SADis) delivers a more precise and customizable solution for stylized image generation. Experiments on images from the WikiArt and StyleDrop datasets demonstrate that, both qualitatively and quantitatively, SADis surpasses state-of-the-art stylization methods in the DisIG task.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a new algorithm for fine-tuning large language models using reinforcement learning. Tapered Off-Policy REINFORCE (TOPR) uses an asymmetric, tapered variant of importance sampling to speed up learning while maintaining stable learning dynamics, even without the use of KL regularization. TOPR can be applied in a fully offline fashion, allows the handling of positive and negative examples in a unified framework, and benefits from the implementational simplicity that is typical of Monte Carlo algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a series of experiments on the GSM8K and MATH reasoning benchmarks, finding performance gains for training both a model for solution generation and as a generative verifier. We show that properly leveraging positive and negative examples alike in the off-policy regime simultaneously increases test-time accuracy and training data efficiency, all the while avoiding the ``wasted inference'' that comes with discarding negative examples. We find that this advantage persists over multiple iterations of training and can be amplified by dataset curation techniques, enabling us to match 70B-parameter model performance with 8B language models. As a corollary to this work, we find that REINFORCE's baseline parameter plays an important and unexpected role in defining dataset composition in the presence of negative examples, and is consequently critical in driving off-policy performance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Studies often aim to reveal how neural representations encode aspects of an observer's environment, such as its contents or structure. These are ``first-order" representations (FORs), because they're ``about" the external world. A less-common target is ``higher-order" representations (HORs), which are ``about" FORs -- their contents, stability, or uncertainty. HORs of uncertainty appear critically involved in adaptive behaviors including learning under uncertainty, influencing learning rates and internal model updating based on environmental feedback. However, HORs about uncertainty are unlikely to be direct ``read-outs" of FOR characteristics, instead reflecting estimation processes which may be lossy, bias-prone, or distortive and which may also incorporate estimates of distributions of uncertainty the observer is likely to experience. While some research has targeted neural representations of ``instantaneously" estimated uncertainty, how the brain represents \textit{distributions} of expected uncertainty remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based generative artificial intelligence (genAI) approach to explore neural representations of uncertainty distributions. We use existing functional magnetic resonance imaging data, where humans learned to `de-noise' their brain states to achieve target neural patterns, to train denoising diffusion genAI models with RL algorithms to learn noise distributions similar to how humans might learn to do the same. We then explore these models' learned noise-distribution HORs compared to control models trained with traditional backpropagation. Results reveal model-dependent differences in noise distribution representations -- with the RL-based model offering much higher explanatory power for human behavior -- offering an exciting path towards using genAI to explore neural noise-distribution HORs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent video diffusion models have enhanced video editing, but it remains challenging to handle instructional editing and diverse tasks (e.g., adding, removing, changing) within a unified framework. In this paper, we introduce VEGGIE, a Video Editor with Grounded Generation from Instructions, a simple end-to-end framework that unifies video concept editing, grounding, and reasoning based on diverse user instructions. Specifically, given a video and text query, VEGGIE first utilizes an MLLM to interpret user intentions in instructions and ground them to the video contexts, generating frame-specific grounded task queries for pixel-space responses. A diffusion model then renders these plans and generates edited videos that align with user intent. To support diverse tasks and complex instructions, we employ a curriculum learning strategy: first aligning the MLLM and video diffusion model with large-scale instructional image editing data, followed by end-to-end fine-tuning on high-quality multitask video data. Additionally, we introduce a novel data synthesis pipeline to generate paired instructional video editing data for model training. It transforms static image data into diverse, high-quality video editing samples by leveraging Image-to-Video models to inject dynamics. VEGGIE shows strong performance in instructional video editing with different editing skills, outperforming the best instructional baseline as a versatile model, while other models struggle with multi-tasking. VEGGIE also excels in video object grounding and reasoning segmentation, where other baselines fail. We further reveal how the multiple tasks help each other and highlight promising applications like zero-shot multimodal instructional and in-context video editing.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate tumor segmentation is crucial for cancer diagnosis and treatment. While foundation models have advanced general-purpose segmentation, existing methods still struggle with: (1) limited incorporation of medical priors, (2) imbalance between generic and tumor-specific features, and (3) high computational costs for clinical adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose MAST-Pro (Mixture-of-experts for Adaptive Segmentation of pan-Tumors with knowledge-driven Prompts), a novel framework that integrates dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (D-MoE) and knowledge-driven prompts for pan-tumor segmentation. Specifically, text and anatomical prompts provide domain-specific priors, guiding tumor representation learning, while D-MoE dynamically selects experts to balance generic and tumor-specific feature learning, improving segmentation accuracy across diverse tumor types. To enhance efficiency, we employ Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), optimizing MAST-Pro with significantly reduced computational overhead. Experiments on multi-anatomical tumor datasets demonstrate that MAST-Pro outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to a 5.20% improvement in average DSC while reducing trainable parameters by 91.04%, without compromising accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Rectified Flow (RF) models trained with a Flow matching framework have achieved state-of-the-art performance on Text-to-Image (T2I) conditional generation. Yet, multiple benchmarks show that synthetic images can still suffer from poor alignment with the prompt, i.e., images show wrong attribute binding, subject positioning, numeracy, etc. While the literature offers many methods to improve T2I alignment, they all consider only Diffusion Models, and require auxiliary datasets, scoring models, and linguistic analysis of the prompt. In this paper we aim to address these gaps. First, we introduce RFMI, a novel Mutual Information (MI) estimator for RF models that uses the pre-trained model itself for the MI estimation. Then, we investigate a self-supervised fine-tuning approach for T2I alignment based on RFMI that does not require auxiliary information other than the pre-trained model itself. Specifically, a fine-tuning set is constructed by selecting synthetic images generated from the pre-trained RF model and having high point-wise MI between images and prompts. Our experiments on MI estimation benchmarks demonstrate the validity of RFMI, and empirical fine-tuning on SD3.5-Medium confirms the effectiveness of RFMI for improving T2I alignment while maintaining image quality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Facial Aesthetics Enhancement (FAE) aims to improve facial attractiveness by adjusting the structure and appearance of a facial image while preserving its identity as much as possible. Most existing methods adopted deep feature-based or score-based guidance for generation models to conduct FAE. Although these methods achieved promising results, they potentially produced excessively beautified results with lower identity consistency or insufficiently improved facial attractiveness. To enhance facial aesthetics with less loss of identity, we propose the Nearest Neighbor Structure Guidance based on Diffusion (NNSG-Diffusion), a diffusion-based FAE method that beautifies a 2D facial image with 3D structure guidance. Specifically, we propose to extract FAE guidance from a nearest neighbor reference face. To allow for less change of facial structures in the FAE process, a 3D face model is recovered by referring to both the matched 2D reference face and the 2D input face, so that the depth and contour guidance can be extracted from the 3D face model. Then the depth and contour clues can provide effective guidance to Stable Diffusion with ControlNet for FAE. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is superior to previous relevant methods in enhancing facial aesthetics while preserving facial identity.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent multi-teacher distillation methods have unified the encoders of multiple foundation models into a single encoder, achieving competitive performance on core vision tasks like classification, segmentation, and depth estimation. This led us to ask: Could similar success be achieved when the pool of teachers also includes vision models specialized in diverse tasks across both 2D and 3D perception? In this paper, we define and investigate the problem of heterogeneous teacher distillation, or co-distillation, a challenging multi-teacher distillation scenario where teacher models vary significantly in both (a) their design objectives and (b) the data they were trained on. We explore data-sharing strategies and teacher-specific encoding, and introduce DUNE, a single encoder excelling in 2D vision, 3D understanding, and 3D human perception. Our model achieves performance comparable to that of its larger teachers, sometimes even outperforming them, on their respective tasks. Notably, DUNE surpasses MASt3R in Map-free Visual Relocalization with a much smaller encoder.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The ever growing realism and quality of generated videos makes it increasingly harder for humans to spot deepfake content, who need to rely more and more on automatic deepfake detectors. However, deepfake detectors are also prone to errors, and their decisions are not explainable, leaving humans vulnerable to deepfake-based fraud and misinformation. To this end, we introduce ExDDV, the first dataset and benchmark for Explainable Deepfake Detection in Video. ExDDV comprises around 5.4K real and deepfake videos that are manually annotated with text descriptions (to explain the artifacts) and clicks (to point out the artifacts). We evaluate a number of vision-language models on ExDDV, performing experiments with various fine-tuning and in-context learning strategies. Our results show that text and click supervision are both required to develop robust explainable models for deepfake videos, which are able to localize and describe the observed artifacts.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-video (T2V) generation has made significant strides with diffusion models. However, existing methods still struggle with accurately binding attributes, determining spatial relationships, and capturing complex action interactions between multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we propose MagicComp, a training-free method that enhances compositional T2V generation through dual-phase refinement. Specifically, (1) During the Conditioning Stage: We introduce the Semantic Anchor Disambiguation to reinforces subject-specific semantics and resolve inter-subject ambiguity by progressively injecting the directional vectors of semantic anchors into original text embedding; (2) During the Denoising Stage: We propose Dynamic Layout Fusion Attention, which integrates grounding priors and model-adaptive spatial perception to flexibly bind subjects to their spatiotemporal regions through masked attention modulation. Furthermore, MagicComp is a model-agnostic and versatile approach, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing T2V architectures. Extensive experiments on T2V-CompBench and VBench demonstrate that MagicComp outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential for applications such as complex prompt-based and trajectory-controllable video generation.

We achieve this by leveraging powerful and scalable existing 2D diffusion network architectures to produce consistent high-fidelity 3D scene representations. To train this model, we create a large-scale multiview-consistent dataset of 3D geometry and appearance by applying state-of-the-art dense 3D reconstruction techniques to existing multiview image datasets. Compared to prior multiview generative models that require per-scene optimization for 3D reconstruction, Bolt3D reduces the inference cost by a factor of up to 300 times.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present RWKV-7 "Goose", a new sequence modeling architecture, along with pre-trained language models that establish a new state-of-the-art in downstream performance at the 3 billion parameter scale on multilingual tasks, and match current SoTA English language performance despite being trained on dramatically fewer tokens than other top 3B models. Nevertheless, RWKV-7 models require only constant memory usage and constant inference time per token. RWKV-7 introduces a newly generalized formulation of the delta rule with vector-valued gating and in-context learning rates, as well as a relaxed value replacement rule. We show that RWKV-7 can perform state tracking and recognize all regular languages, while retaining parallelizability of training. This exceeds the capabilities of Transformers under standard complexity conjectures, which are limited to $\mathsf{TC}^0$. To demonstrate RWKV-7's language modeling capability, we also present an extended open source 3.1 trillion token multilingual corpus, and train four RWKV-7 models ranging from 0.19 billion to 2.9 billion parameters on this dataset.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The computer vision community has developed numerous techniques for digitally restoring true scene information from single-view degraded photographs, an important yet extremely ill-posed task. In this work, we tackle image restoration from a different perspective by jointly denoising multiple photographs of the same scene. Our core hypothesis is that degraded images capturing a shared scene contain complementary information that, when combined, better constrains the restoration problem. To this end, we implement a powerful multi-view diffusion model that jointly generates uncorrupted views by extracting rich information from multi-view relationships. Our experiments show that our multi-view approach outperforms existing single-view image and even video-based methods on image deblurring and super-resolution tasks. Critically, our model is trained to output 3D consistent images, making it a promising tool for applications requiring robust multi-view integration, such as 3D reconstruction or pose estimation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Creativity is a fundamental aspect of intelligence, involving the ability to generate novel and appropriate solutions across diverse contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for their creative capabilities, the assessment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Creation-MMBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the creative capabilities of MLLMs in real-world, image-based tasks. The benchmark comprises 765 test cases spanning 51 fine-grained tasks. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we define instance-specific evaluation criteria for each test case, guiding the assessment of both general response quality and factual consistency with visual inputs. Experimental results reveal that current open-source MLLMs significantly underperform compared to proprietary models in creative tasks. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that visual fine-tuning can negatively impact the base LLM's creative abilities. Creation-MMBench provides valuable insights for advancing MLLM creativity and establishes a foundation for future improvements in multimodal generative intelligence.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various image generation tasks, but their performance is often limited by the uniform processing of inputs across varying conditions and noise levels. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that leverages the inherent heterogeneity of the diffusion process. Our method, DiffMoE, introduces a batch-level global token pool that enables experts to access global token distributions during training, promoting specialized expert behavior. To unleash the full potential of the diffusion process, DiffMoE incorporates a capacity predictor that dynamically allocates computational resources based on noise levels and sample complexity. Through comprehensive evaluation, DiffMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models on ImageNet benchmark, substantially outperforming both dense architectures with 3x activated parameters and existing MoE approaches while maintaining 1x activated parameters. The effectiveness of our approach extends beyond class-conditional generation to more challenging tasks such as text-to-image generation, demonstrating its broad applicability across different diffusion model applications.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present Stable Virtual Camera (Seva), a generalist diffusion model that creates novel views of a scene, given any number of input views and target cameras. Existing works struggle to generate either large viewpoint changes or temporally smooth samples, while relying on specific task configurations. Our approach overcomes these limitations through simple model design, optimized training recipe, and flexible sampling strategy that generalize across view synthesis tasks at test time. As a result, our samples maintain high consistency without requiring additional 3D representation-based distillation, thus streamlining view synthesis in the wild. Furthermore, we show that our method can generate high-quality videos lasting up to half a minute with seamless loop closure. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates that Seva outperforms existing methods across different datasets and settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Flow based generative models have charted an impressive path across multiple visual generation tasks by adhering to a simple principle: learning velocity representations of a linear interpolant. However, we observe that training velocity solely from the final layer output underutilizes the rich inter layer representations, potentially impeding model convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepFlow, a novel framework that enhances velocity representation through inter layer communication. DeepFlow partitions transformer layers into balanced branches with deep supervision and inserts a lightweight Velocity Refiner with Acceleration (VeRA) block between adjacent branches, which aligns the intermediate velocity features within transformer blocks. Powered by the improved deep supervision via the internal velocity alignment, DeepFlow converges 8 times faster on ImageNet with equivalent performance and further reduces FID by 2.6 while halving training time compared to previous flow based models without a classifier free guidance. DeepFlow also outperforms baselines in text to image generation tasks, as evidenced by evaluations on MSCOCO and zero shot GenEval.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently gained prominence in autonomous driving research, showcasing promising capabilities across various emerging benchmarks. LMMs specifically designed for this domain have demonstrated effective perception, planning, and prediction skills. However, many of these methods underutilize 3D spatial and temporal elements, relying mainly on image data. As a result, their effectiveness in dynamic driving environments is limited. We propose to integrate tracking information as an additional input to recover 3D spatial and temporal details that are not effectively captured in the images. We introduce a novel approach for embedding this tracking information into LMMs to enhance their spatiotemporal understanding of driving scenarios. By incorporating 3D tracking data through a track encoder, we enrich visual queries with crucial spatial and temporal cues while avoiding the computational overhead associated with processing lengthy video sequences or extensive 3D inputs. Moreover, we employ a self-supervised approach to pretrain the tracking encoder to provide LMMs with additional contextual information, significantly improving their performance in perception, planning, and prediction tasks for autonomous driving. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with a gain of 9.5% in accuracy, an increase of 7.04 points in the ChatGPT score, and 9.4% increase in the overall score over baseline models on DriveLM-nuScenes benchmark, along with a 3.7% final score improvement on DriveLM-CARLA.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative artificial intelligence has witnessed remarkable advancements across multiple domains in recent years. Building on the successes of 2D and 3D content generation, 4D generation, which incorporates the temporal dimension into generative tasks, has emerged as a burgeoning yet rapidly evolving research area. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of this emerging field, systematically examining its theoretical foundations, key methodologies, and practical applications, with the aim of providing readers with a holistic understanding of the current state and future potential of 4D generation. We begin by introducing the core concepts of 4D data representations, encompassing both structured and unstructured formats, and their implications for generative tasks. Building upon this foundation, we delve into the enabling technologies that drive 4D generation, including advancements in spatiotemporal modeling, neural representations, and generative frameworks. We further review recent studies that employ diverse control mechanisms and representation strategies for generating 4D outputs, categorizing these approaches and summarizing their research trajectories. In addition, we explore the wide-ranging applications of 4D generation techniques, spanning dynamic object modeling, scene generation, digital human synthesis, 4D content editing, and autonomous driving. Finally, we analyze the key challenges inherent to 4D generation, such as data availability, computational efficiency, and spatiotemporal consistency, and propose promising directions for future research.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Single-image super-resolution (SISR) remains challenging due to the inherent difficulty of recovering fine-grained details and preserving perceptual quality from low-resolution inputs. Existing methods often rely on limited image priors, leading to suboptimal results. We propose a novel approach that leverages the rich contextual information available in multiple modalities -- including depth, segmentation, edges, and text prompts -- to learn a powerful generative prior for SISR within a diffusion model framework. We introduce a flexible network architecture that effectively fuses multimodal information, accommodating an arbitrary number of input modalities without requiring significant modifications to the diffusion process. Crucially, we mitigate hallucinations, often introduced by text prompts, by using spatial information from other modalities to guide regional text-based conditioning. Each modality's guidance strength can also be controlled independently, allowing steering outputs toward different directions, such as increasing bokeh through depth or adjusting object prominence via segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-art generative SISR methods, achieving superior visual quality and fidelity. See project page at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce MusicInfuser, an approach for generating high-quality dance videos that are synchronized to a specified music track. Rather than attempting to design and train a new multimodal audio-video model, we show how existing video diffusion models can be adapted to align with musical inputs by introducing lightweight music-video cross-attention and a low-rank adapter. Unlike prior work requiring motion capture data, our approach fine-tunes only on dance videos. MusicInfuser achieves high-quality music-driven video generation while preserving the flexibility and generative capabilities of the underlying models. We introduce an evaluation framework using Video-LLMs to assess multiple dimensions of dance generation quality. The project page and code are available at this https URL.</li>
