<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a generative model that amortises computation for the field around e.g. gravitational or magnetic sources. Exact numerical calculation has either computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(M\times{}N)$ in the number of sources and field evaluation points, or requires a fixed evaluation grid to exploit fast Fourier transforms. Using an architecture where a hypernetwork produces an implicit representation of the field around a source collection, our model instead performs as $\mathcal{O}(M + N)$, achieves accuracy of $\sim\!4\%-6\%$, and allows evaluation at arbitrary locations for arbitrary numbers of sources, greatly increasing the speed of e.g. physics simulations. We also examine a model relating to the physical properties of the output field and develop two-dimensional examples to demonstrate its application. The code for these models and experiments is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent developments in large speech foundation models like Whisper have led to their widespread use in many automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. These systems incorporate `special tokens' in their vocabulary, such as $\texttt{<endoftext>}$, to guide their language generation process. However, we demonstrate that these tokens can be exploited by adversarial attacks to manipulate the model's behavior. We propose a simple yet effective method to learn a universal acoustic realization of Whisper's $\texttt{<endoftext>}$ token, which, when prepended to any speech signal, encourages the model to ignore the speech and only transcribe the special token, effectively `muting' the model. Our experiments demonstrate that the same, universal 0.64-second adversarial audio segment can successfully mute a target Whisper ASR model for over 97\% of speech samples. Moreover, we find that this universal adversarial audio segment often transfers to new datasets and tasks. Overall this work demonstrates the vulnerability of Whisper models to `muting' adversarial attacks, where such attacks can pose both risks and potential benefits in real-world settings: for example the attack can be used to bypass speech moderation systems, or conversely the attack can also be used to protect private speech data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Real-world graphs are complex to process for performing effective analysis, such as anomaly detection. However, recently, there have been several research efforts addressing the issues surrounding graph-based anomaly detection. In this paper, we discuss a comprehensive overview of anomaly detection techniques on graph data. We also discuss the various application domains which use those anomaly detection techniques. We present a new taxonomy that categorizes the different state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods based on assumptions and techniques. Within each category, we discuss the fundamental research ideas that have been done to improve anomaly detection. We further discuss the advantages and disadvantages of current anomaly detection techniques. Finally, we present potential future research directions in anomaly detection on graph-structured data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In everyday indoor navigation, robots often needto detect non-distinctive small-change objects (e.g., stationery,lost items, and junk, etc.) to maintain domain knowledge. Thisis most relevant to ground-view change detection (GVCD), a recently emerging research area in the field of computer vision.However, these existing techniques rely on high-quality class-specific object priors to regularize a change detector modelthat cannot be applied to semantically nondistinctive smallobjects. To address ill-posedness, in this study, we explorethe concept of degree-of-ill-posedness (DoI) from the newperspective of GVCD, aiming to improve both passive and activevision. This novel DoI problem is highly domain-dependent,and manually collecting fine-grained annotated training datais expensive. To regularize this problem, we apply the conceptof self-supervised learning to achieve efficient DoI estimationscheme and investigate its generalization to diverse datasets.Specifically, we tackle the challenging issue of obtaining self-supervision cues for semantically non-distinctive unseen smallobjects and show that novel "oversegmentation cues" from openvocabulary semantic segmentation can be effectively exploited.When applied to diverse real datasets, the proposed DoI modelcan boost state-of-the-art change detection models, and it showsstable and consistent improvements when evaluated on real-world datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large unlabeled data and difficult-to-identify anomalies are the urgent issues need to overcome in most industrial scene. In order to address this issue, a new meth-odology for detecting surface defects in in-dustrial settings is introduced, referred to as Memory Augmentation and Pseudo-Labeling(MAPL). The methodology first in-troduces an anomaly simulation strategy, which significantly improves the model's ability to recognize rare or unknown anom-aly types by generating simulated anomaly samples. To cope with the problem of the lack of labeling of anomalous simulated samples, a pseudo-labeler method based on a one-classifier ensemble was employed in this study, which enhances the robustness of the model in the case of limited labeling data by automatically selecting key pseudo-labeling hyperparameters. Meanwhile, a memory-enhanced learning mechanism is introduced to effectively predict abnormal regions by analyzing the difference be-tween the input samples and the normal samples in the memory pool. An end-to-end learning framework is employed by MAPL to identify the abnormal regions directly from the input data, which optimizes the ef-ficiency and real-time performance of de-tection. By conducting extensive trials on the recently developed BHAD dataset (in-cluding MVTec AD [1], Visa [2], and MDPP [3]), MAPL achieves an average im-age-level AUROC score of 86.2%, demon-strating a 5.1% enhancement compared to the original MemSeg [4] model.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As one of the most advanced techniques in AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques can offer reliable and up-to-date external knowledge, providing huge convenience for numerous tasks. Particularly in the era of AI-generated content (AIGC), the powerful capacity of retrieval in RAG in providing additional knowledge enables retrieval-augmented generation to assist existing generative AI in producing high-quality outputs. Recently, large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated revolutionary abilities in language understanding and generation, while still facing inherent limitations, such as hallucinations and out-of-date internal knowledge. Given the powerful abilities of RAG in providing the latest and helpful auxiliary information, retrieval-augmented large language models have emerged to harness external and authoritative knowledge bases, rather than solely relying on the model's internal knowledge, to augment the generation quality of LLMs. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies in retrieval-augmented large language models (RA-LLMs), covering three primary technical perspectives: architectures, training strategies, and applications. As the preliminary knowledge, we briefly introduce the foundations and recent advances of LLMs. Then, to illustrate the practical significance of RAG for LLMs, we categorize mainstream relevant work by application areas, detailing specifically the challenges of each and the corresponding capabilities of RA-LLMs. Finally, to deliver deeper insights, we discuss current limitations and several promising directions for future research.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Conventional methods in semi-supervised learning (SSL) often face challenges related to limited data utilization, mainly due to their reliance on threshold-based techniques for selecting high-confidence unlabeled data during training. Various efforts (e.g., FreeMatch) have been made to enhance data utilization by tweaking the thresholds, yet none have managed to use 100% of the available data. To overcome this limitation and improve SSL performance, we introduce \algo, a novel algorithm that fully utilizes unlabeled data to boost semi-supervised learning. \algo integrates a self-supervised learning strategy, i.e., Masked Autoencoder (MAE), that uses all available data to enforce the visual representation learning. This enables the SSL algorithm to leverage all available data, including samples typically filtered out by traditional methods. In addition, we propose a synthetic data training approach to further increase data utilization and improve generalization. These innovations lead \algo to achieve state-of-the-art results on challenging datasets. For instance, on CIFAR-100 with 2 labels per class, STL-10 with 4 labels per class, and Euro-SAT with 2 labels per class, \algo achieves low error rates of 18.71%, 9.47%, and 3.07%, respectively. The code will be made publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the realm of time series analysis, accurately measuring similarity is crucial for applications such as forecasting, anomaly detection, and clustering. However, existing metrics often fail to capture the complex, multidimensional nature of time series data, limiting their effectiveness and application. This paper introduces the Structured Similarity Index Measure for Time Series (TS3IM), a novel approach inspired by the success of the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) in image analysis, tailored to address these limitations by assessing structural similarity in time series. TS3IM evaluates multiple dimensions of similarity-trend, variability, and structural integrity-offering a more nuanced and comprehensive measure. This metric represents a significant leap forward, providing a robust tool for analyzing temporal data and offering more accurate and comprehensive sequence analysis and decision support in fields such as monitoring power consumption, analyzing traffic flow, and adversarial recognition. Our extensive experimental results also show that compared with traditional methods that rely heavily on computational correlation, TS3IM is 1.87 times more similar to Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in evaluation results and improves by more than 50% in adversarial recognition.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare diagnostics offers a promising avenue for clinical decision-making. This study outlines the development of a novel method for zero-shot/few-shot in-context learning (ICL) by integrating medical domain knowledge using a multi-layered structured prompt. We also explore the efficacy of two communication styles between the user and LLMs: the Numerical Conversational (NC) style, which processes data incrementally, and the Natural Language Single-Turn (NL-ST) style, which employs long narrative prompts. Our study systematically evaluates the diagnostic accuracy and risk factors, including gender bias and false negative rates, using a dataset of 920 patient records in various few-shot scenarios. Results indicate that traditional clinical machine learning (ML) models generally outperform LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings. However, the performance gap narrows significantly when employing few-shot examples alongside effective explainable AI (XAI) methods as sources of domain knowledge. Moreover, with sufficient time and an increased number of examples, the conversational style (NC) nearly matches the performance of ML models. Most notably, LLMs demonstrate comparable or superior cost-sensitive accuracy relative to ML models. This research confirms that, with appropriate domain knowledge and tailored communication strategies, LLMs can significantly enhance diagnostic processes. The findings highlight the importance of optimizing the number of training examples and communication styles to improve accuracy and reduce biases in LLM applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning has been able to outperform humans in terms of classification accuracy in many tasks. However, to achieve robustness to adversarial perturbations, the best methodologies require to perform adversarial training on a much larger training set that has been typically augmented using generative models (e.g., diffusion models). Our main objective in this work, is to reduce these data requirements while achieving the same or better accuracy-robustness trade-offs. We focus on data pruning, where some training samples are removed based on the distance to the model classification boundary (i.e., margin). We find that the existing approaches that prune samples with low margin fails to increase robustness when we add a lot of synthetic data, and explain this situation with a perceptron learning task. Moreover, we find that pruning high margin samples for better accuracy increases the harmful impact of mislabeled perturbed data in adversarial training, hurting both robustness and accuracy. We thus propose PUMA, a new data pruning strategy that computes the margin using DeepFool, and prunes the training samples of highest margin without hurting performance by jointly adjusting the training attack norm on the samples of lowest margin. We show that PUMA can be used on top of the current state-of-the-art methodology in robustness, and it is able to significantly improve the model performance unlike the existing data pruning strategies. Not only PUMA achieves similar robustness with less data, but it also significantly increases the model accuracy, improving the performance trade-off.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated Learning faces significant challenges in statistical and system heterogeneity, along with high energy consumption, necessitating efficient client selection strategies. Traditional approaches, including heuristic and learning-based methods, fall short of addressing these complexities holistically. In response, we propose FedGCS, a novel generative client selection framework that innovatively recasts the client selection process as a generative task. Drawing inspiration from the methodologies used in large language models, FedGCS efficiently encodes abundant decision-making knowledge within a continuous representation space, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization to search for optimal client selection that will be finally output via generation. The framework comprises four steps: (1) automatic collection of diverse "selection-score" pair data using classical client selection methods; (2) training an encoder-evaluator-decoder framework on this data to construct a continuous representation space; (3) employing gradient-based optimization in this space for optimal client selection; (4) generating the final optimal client selection via using beam search for the well-trained decoder. FedGCS outperforms traditional methods by being more comprehensive, generalizable, and efficient, simultaneously optimizing for model performance, latency, and energy consumption. The effectiveness of FedGCS is proven through extensive experimental analyses.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We consider the problem of learning an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in a general class of continuous-space Markov decision processes (MDPs) having smooth Bellman operators. Given access to a generative model, we achieve rate-optimal sample complexity by performing a simple, \emph{perturbed} version of least-squares value iteration with orthogonal trigonometric polynomials as features. Key to our solution is a novel projection technique based on ideas from harmonic analysis. Our~$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2-d/(\nu+1)})$ sample complexity, where $d$ is the dimension of the state-action space and $\nu$ the order of smoothness, recovers the state-of-the-art result of discretization approaches for the special case of Lipschitz MDPs $(\nu=0)$. At the same time, for $\nu\to\infty$, it recovers and greatly generalizes the $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ rate of low-rank MDPs, which are more amenable to regression approaches. In this sense, our result bridges the gap between two popular but conflicting perspectives on continuous-space MDPs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative approaches have significantly influenced Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), garnering considerable attention. However, existing studies often predict target text components monolithically, neglecting the benefits of utilizing single elements for tuple prediction. In this paper, we introduce Element to Tuple Prompting (E2TP), employing a two-step architecture. The former step focuses on predicting single elements, while the latter step completes the process by mapping these predicted elements to their corresponding tuples. E2TP is inspired by human problem-solving, breaking down tasks into manageable parts, using the first step's output as a guide in the second step. Within this strategy, three types of paradigms, namely E2TP($diet$), E2TP($f_1$), and E2TP($f_2$), are designed to facilitate the training process. Beyond in-domain task-specific experiments, our paper addresses cross-domain scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of the approach. By conducting a comprehensive analysis on various benchmarks, we show that E2TP achieves new state-of-the-art results in nearly all cases.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised anomaly detection encompasses diverse applications in industrial settings where a high-throughput and precision is imperative. Early works were centered around one-class-one-model paradigm, which poses significant challenges in large-scale production environments. Knowledge-distillation based multi-class anomaly detection promises a low latency with a reasonably good performance but with a significant drop as compared to one-class version. We propose a DCAM (Distributed Convolutional Attention Module) which improves the distillation process between teacher and student networks when there is a high variance among multiple classes or objects. Integrated multi-scale feature matching strategy to utilise a mixture of multi-level knowledge from the feature pyramid of the two networks, intuitively helping in detecting anomalies of varying sizes which is also an inherent problem in the multi-class scenario. Briefly, our DCAM module consists of Convolutional Attention blocks distributed across the feature maps of the student network, which essentially learns to masks the irrelevant information during student learning alleviating the "cross-class interference" problem. This process is accompanied by minimizing the relative entropy using KL-Divergence in Spatial dimension and a Channel-wise Cosine Similarity between the same feature maps of teacher and student. The losses enables to achieve scale-invariance and capture non-linear relationships. We also highlight that the DCAM module would only be used during training and not during inference as we only need the learned feature maps and losses for anomaly scoring and hence, gaining a performance gain of 3.92% than the multi-class baseline with a preserved latency.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Compositional image generation requires models to generalise well in situations where two or more input concepts do not necessarily appear together in training (compositional generalisation). Despite recent progress in compositional image generation via composing continuous sampling processes such as diffusion and energy-based models, composing discrete generative processes has remained an open challenge, with the promise of providing improvements in efficiency, interpretability and simplicity. To this end, we propose a formulation for controllable conditional generation of images via composing the log-probability outputs of discrete generative models of the latent space. Our approach, when applied alongside VQ-VAE and VQ-GAN, achieves state-of-the-art generation accuracy in three distinct settings (FFHQ, Positional CLEVR and Relational CLEVR) while attaining competitive Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores. Our method attains an average generation accuracy of $80.71\%$ across the studied settings. Our method also outperforms the next-best approach (ranked by accuracy) in terms of FID in seven out of nine experiments, with an average FID of $24.23$ (an average improvement of $-9.58$). Furthermore, our method offers a $2.3\times$ to $12\times$ speedup over comparable continuous compositional methods on our hardware. We find that our method can generalise to combinations of input conditions that lie outside the training data (e.g. more objects per image) in addition to offering an interpretable dimension of controllability via concept weighting. We further demonstrate that our approach can be readily applied to an open pre-trained discrete text-to-image model without any fine-tuning, allowing for fine-grained control of text-to-image generation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>One image to editable dynamic 3D model and video generation is novel direction and change in the research area of single image to 3D representation or 3D reconstruction of image. Gaussian Splatting has demonstrated its advantages in implicit 3D reconstruction, compared with the original Neural Radiance Fields. As the rapid development of technologies and principles, people tried to used the Stable Diffusion models to generate targeted models with text instructions. However, using the normal implicit machine learning methods is hard to gain the precise motions and actions control, further more, it is difficult to generate a long content and semantic continuous 3D video. To address this issue, we propose the OneTo3D, a method and theory to used one single image to generate the editable 3D model and generate the targeted semantic continuous time-unlimited 3D video. We used a normal basic Gaussian Splatting model to generate the 3D model from a single image, which requires less volume of video memory and computer calculation ability. Subsequently, we designed an automatic generation and self-adaptive binding mechanism for the object armature. Combined with the re-editable motions and actions analyzing and controlling algorithm we proposed, we can achieve a better performance than the SOTA projects in the area of building the 3D model precise motions and actions control, and generating a stable semantic continuous time-unlimited 3D video with the input text instructions. Here we will analyze the detailed implementation methods and theories analyses. Relative comparisons and conclusions will be presented. The project code is open source.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Semantic segmentation is a core computer vision problem, but the high costs of data annotation have hindered its wide application. Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) offers a cost-efficient workaround to extensive labeling in comparison to fully-supervised methods by using partial or incomplete labels. Existing WSSS methods have difficulties in learning the boundaries of objects leading to poor segmentation results. We propose a novel and effective framework that addresses these issues by leveraging visual foundation models inside the bounding box. Adopting a two-stage WSSS framework, our proposed network consists of a pseudo-label generation module and a segmentation module. The first stage leverages Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate high-quality pseudo-labels. To alleviate the problem of delineating precise boundaries, we adopt SAM inside the bounding box with the help of another pre-trained foundation model (e.g., Grounding-DINO). Furthermore, we eliminate the necessity of using the supervision of image labels, by employing CLIP in classification. Then in the second stage, the generated high-quality pseudo-labels are used to train an off-the-shelf segmenter that achieves the state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As Transformers have become state-of-the-art models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the need to understand and explain their predictions is increasingly apparent. Especially in unsupervised applications, such as information retrieval tasks, similarity models built on top of foundation model representations have been widely applied. However, their inner prediction mechanisms have mostly remained opaque. Recent advances in explainable AI have made it possible to mitigate these limitations by leveraging improved explanations for Transformers through layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP). Using BiLRP, an extension developed for computing second-order explanations in bilinear similarity models, we investigate which feature interactions drive similarity in NLP models. We validate the resulting explanations and demonstrate their utility in three corpus-level use cases, analyzing grammatical interactions, multilingual semantics, and biomedical text retrieval. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of different semantic similarity tasks and models, highlighting how novel explainable AI methods enable in-depth analyses and corpus-level insights.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Linear transformers have emerged as a subquadratic-time alternative to softmax attention and have garnered significant interest due to their fixed-size recurrent state that lowers inference cost. However, their original formulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched transformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating architectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data and compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is limited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a cost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models.
