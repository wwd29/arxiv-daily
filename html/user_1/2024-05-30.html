<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work aims to generate natural and diverse group motions of multiple humans from textual descriptions. While single-person text-to-motion generation is extensively studied, it remains challenging to synthesize motions for more than one or two subjects from in-the-wild prompts, mainly due to the lack of available datasets. In this work, we curate human pose and motion datasets by estimating pose information from large-scale image and video datasets. Our models use a transformer-based diffusion framework that accommodates multiple datasets with any number of subjects or frames. Experiments explore both generation of multi-person static poses and generation of multi-person motion sequences. To our knowledge, our method is the first to generate multi-subject motion sequences with high diversity and fidelity from a large variety of textual prompts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Satellite images have the potential to detect volcanic deformation prior to eruptions, but while a vast number of images are routinely acquired, only a small percentage contain volcanic deformation events. Manual inspection could miss these anomalies, and an automatic system modelled with supervised learning requires suitably labelled datasets. To tackle these issues, this paper explores the use of unsupervised deep learning on satellite data for the purpose of identifying volcanic deformation as anomalies. Our detector is based on Patch Distribution Modeling (PaDiM), and the detection performance is enhanced with a weighted distance, assigning greater importance to features from deeper layers. Additionally, we propose a preprocessing approach to handle noisy and incomplete data points. The final framework was tested with five volcanoes, which have different deformation characteristics and its performance was compared against the supervised learning method for volcanic deformation detection.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing diffusion-based text-to-3D generation methods primarily focus on producing visually realistic shapes and appearances, often neglecting the physical constraints necessary for downstream tasks. Generated models frequently fail to maintain balance when placed in physics-based simulations or 3D printed. This balance is crucial for satisfying user design intentions in interactive gaming, embodied AI, and robotics, where stable models are needed for reliable interaction. Additionally, stable models ensure that 3D-printed objects, such as figurines for home decoration, can stand on their own without requiring additional supports. To fill this gap, we introduce Atlas3D, an automatic and easy-to-implement method that enhances existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based text-to-3D tools. Atlas3D ensures the generation of self-supporting 3D models that adhere to physical laws of stability under gravity, contact, and friction. Our approach combines a novel differentiable simulation-based loss function with physically inspired regularization, serving as either a refinement or a post-processing module for existing frameworks. We verify Atlas3D's efficacy through extensive generation tasks and validate the resulting 3D models in both simulated and real-world environments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Verifying safety of neural network control systems that use images as input is a difficult problem because, from a given system state, there is no known way to mathematically model what images are possible in the real-world. We build on recent work that considers a surrogate verification approach, training a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) as an image generator in place of the real world. This enables set-based formal analysis of the closed-loop system, providing analysis beyond simulation and testing. While existing work is effective on small examples, excessive overapproximation both within a single control period and across multiple control periods limits its scalability. We propose approaches to overcome these two sources of error. First, we overcome one-step error by composing the system's dynamics along with the cGAN and neural network controller, without losing the dependencies between input states and the control outputs as in the monotonic analysis of the system dynamics. Second, we reduce multi-step error by repeating the single-step composition, essentially unrolling multiple steps of the control loop into a large neural network. We then leverage existing network verification tools to compute accurate reachable sets for multiple steps, avoiding the accumulation of abstraction error at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both accuracy and scalability using two case studies: an autonomous aircraft taxiing system and an advanced emergency braking system. On the aircraft taxiing system, the converged reachable set is 175% larger using the prior baseline method compared with our proposed approach. On the emergency braking system, with 24x the number of image output variables from the cGAN, the baseline method fails to prove any states are safe, whereas our improvements enable set-based safety analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Train-time data poisoning attacks threaten machine learning models by introducing adversarial examples during training, leading to misclassification. Current defense methods often reduce generalization performance, are attack-specific, and impose significant training overhead. To address this, we introduce a set of universal data purification methods using a stochastic transform, $\Psi(x)$, realized via iterative Langevin dynamics of Energy-Based Models (EBMs), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), or both. These approaches purify poisoned data with minimal impact on classifier generalization. Our specially trained EBMs and DDPMs provide state-of-the-art defense against various attacks (including Narcissus, Bullseye Polytope, Gradient Matching) on CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet, and CINIC-10, without needing attack or classifier-specific information. We discuss performance trade-offs and show that our methods remain highly effective even with poisoned or distributionally shifted generative model training data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model, in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Going beyond mimicking limited human experiences, recent studies show initial evidence that, like humans, large language models (LLMs) are capable of improving their abilities purely by self-correction, i.e., correcting previous responses through self-examination, in certain circumstances. Nevertheless, little is known about how such capabilities arise. In this work, based on a simplified setup akin to an alignment task, we theoretically analyze self-correction from an in-context learning perspective, showing that when LLMs give relatively accurate self-examinations as rewards, they are capable of refining responses in an in-context way. Notably, going beyond previous theories on over-simplified linear transformers, our theoretical construction underpins the roles of several key designs of realistic transformers for self-correction: softmax attention, multi-head attention, and the MLP block. We validate these findings extensively on synthetic datasets. Inspired by these findings, we also illustrate novel applications of self-correction, such as defending against LLM jailbreaks, where a simple self-correction step does make a large difference. We believe that these findings will inspire further research on understanding, exploiting, and enhancing self-correction for building better foundation models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detecting data points deviating from the training distribution is pivotal for ensuring reliable machine learning. Extensive research has been dedicated to the challenge, spanning classical anomaly detection techniques to contemporary out-of-distribution (OOD) detection approaches. While OOD detection commonly relies on supervised learning from a labeled in-distribution (ID) dataset, anomaly detection may treat the entire ID data as a single class and disregard ID labels. This fundamental distinction raises a significant question that has yet to be rigorously explored: when and how does ID label help OOD detection? This paper bridges this gap by offering a formal understanding to theoretically delineate the impact of ID labels on OOD detection. We employ a graph-theoretic approach, rigorously analyzing the separability of ID data from OOD data in a closed-form manner. Key to our approach is the characterization of data representations through spectral decomposition on the graph. Leveraging these representations, we establish a provable error bound that compares the OOD detection performance with and without ID labels, unveiling conditions for achieving enhanced OOD detection. Lastly, we present empirical results on both simulated and real datasets, validating theoretical guarantees and reinforcing our insights. Code is publicly available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this position paper, we argue that human evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs) should be a multidisciplinary undertaking that draws upon insights from disciplines such as user experience research and human behavioral psychology to ensure that the experimental design and results are reliable. The conclusions from these evaluations, thus, must consider factors such as usability, aesthetics, and cognitive biases. We highlight how cognitive biases can conflate fluent information and truthfulness, and how cognitive uncertainty affects the reliability of rating scores such as Likert. Furthermore, the evaluation should differentiate the capabilities and weaknesses of increasingly powerful large language models -- which requires effective test sets. The scalability of human evaluation is also crucial to wider adoption. Hence, to design an effective human evaluation system in the age of generative NLP, we propose the ConSiDERS-The-Human evaluation framework consisting of 6 pillars --Consistency, Scoring Critera, Differentiating, User Experience, Responsible, and Scalability.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite their remarkable progress, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) tend to hallucinate factually inaccurate information. In this work, we address object hallucinations in MLLMs, where information is offered about an object that is not present in the model input. We introduce a contrastive tuning method that can be applied to a pretrained off-the-shelf MLLM for mitigating hallucinations while preserving its general vision-language capabilities. For a given factual token, we create a hallucinated token through generative data augmentation by selectively altering the ground-truth information. The proposed contrastive tuning is applied at the token level to improve the relative likelihood of the factual token compared to the hallucinated one. Our thorough evaluation confirms the effectiveness of contrastive tuning in mitigating hallucination. Moreover, the proposed contrastive tuning is simple, fast, and requires minimal training with no additional overhead at inference.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Integrating multiple generative foundation models, especially those trained on different modalities, into something greater than the sum of its parts poses significant challenges. Two key hurdles are the availability of aligned data (concepts that contain similar meaning but is expressed differently in different modalities), and effectively leveraging unimodal representations in cross-domain generative tasks, without compromising their original unimodal capabilities. We propose Zipper, a multi-tower decoder architecture that addresses these concerns by using cross-attention to flexibly compose multimodal generative models from independently pre-trained unimodal decoders. In our experiments fusing speech and text modalities, we show the proposed architecture performs very competitively in scenarios with limited aligned text-speech data. We also showcase the flexibility of our model to selectively maintain unimodal (e.g., text-to-text generation) generation performance by freezing the corresponding modal tower (e.g. text). In cross-modal tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) where the output modality is text, we show that freezing the text backbone results in negligible performance degradation. In cross-modal tasks such as text-to-speech generation (TTS) where the output modality is speech, we show that using a pre-trained speech backbone results in superior performance to the baseline.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating realistic images from arbitrary views based on a single source image remains a significant challenge in computer vision, with broad applications ranging from e-commerce to immersive virtual experiences. Recent advancements in diffusion models, particularly the Zero-1-to-3 model, have been widely adopted for generating plausible views, videos, and 3D models. However, these models still struggle with inconsistencies and implausibility in new views generation, especially for challenging changes in viewpoint. In this work, we propose Zero-to-Hero, a novel test-time approach that enhances view synthesis by manipulating attention maps during the denoising process of Zero-1-to-3. By drawing an analogy between the denoising process and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we implement a filtering mechanism that aggregates attention maps, enhancing generation reliability and authenticity. This process improves geometric consistency without requiring retraining or significant computational resources. Additionally, we modify the self-attention mechanism to integrate information from the source view, reducing shape distortions. These processes are further supported by a specialized sampling schedule. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in fidelity and consistency, validated on a diverse set of out-of-distribution objects.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffeomorphic image registration (DIR) is a critical task in 3D medical image analysis, aimed at finding topology preserving deformations between pairs of images. Focusing on the solution of the flow map differential equation as the diffeomorphic deformation, recent methods use discrete timesteps along with various regularization terms to penalize the negative determinant of Jacobian and impose smoothness of the solution vector field. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based approach for diffeomorphic 3D-image registration which finds the diffeomorphisms in the time continuum with fewer regularization terms and no additional integration. As one of the fundamental properties of flow maps, we exploit the semigroup property as the only form of regularization, ensuring temporally continuous diffeomorphic flows between pairs of images. Leveraging this property, our method alleviates the need for additional regularization terms and scaling and squaring integration during both training and evaluation. To achieve time-continuous diffeomorphisms, we employ time-embedded UNets, a technique commonly utilized in diffusion models. The proposed method reveals that ensuring diffeomorphism in a continuous time interval leads to better registration results. Experimental results on two public datasets (OASIS and CANDI) demonstrate the superiority of our model over both learning-based and optimization-based methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Inferring 3D human motion is fundamental in many applications, including understanding human activity and analyzing one's intention. While many fruitful efforts have been made to human motion prediction, most approaches focus on pose-driven prediction and inferring human motion in isolation from the contextual environment, thus leaving the body location movement in the scene behind. However, real-world human movements are goal-directed and highly influenced by the spatial layout of their surrounding scenes. In this paper, instead of planning future human motion in a 'dark' room, we propose a Multi-Condition Latent Diffusion network (MCLD) that reformulates the human motion prediction task as a multi-condition joint inference problem based on the given historical 3D body motion and the current 3D scene contexts. Specifically, instead of directly modeling joint distribution over the raw motion sequences, MCLD performs a conditional diffusion process within the latent embedding space, characterizing the cross-modal mapping from the past body movement and current scene context condition embeddings to the future human motion embedding. Extensive experiments on large-scale human motion prediction datasets demonstrate that our MCLD achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on both realistic and diverse predictions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces a novel approach to sketch colourisation, inspired by the universal childhood activity of colouring and its professional applications in design and story-boarding. Striking a balance between precision and convenience, our method utilises region masks and colour palettes to allow intuitive user control, steering clear of the meticulousness of manual colour assignments or the limitations of textual prompts. By strategically combining ControlNet and staged generation, incorporating Stable Diffusion v1.5, and leveraging BLIP-2 text prompts, our methodology facilitates faithful image generation and user-directed colourisation. Addressing challenges of local and global consistency, we employ inventive solutions such as an inversion scheme, guided sampling, and a self-attention mechanism with a scaling factor. The resulting tool is not only fast and training-free but also compatible with consumer-grade Nvidia RTX 4090 Super GPUs, making it a valuable asset for both creative professionals and enthusiasts in various fields.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn optimal policies from previously collected datasets. Recently, due to their powerful representational capabilities, diffusion models have shown significant potential as policy models for offline RL issues. However, previous offline RL algorithms based on diffusion policies generally adopt weighted regression to improve the policy. This approach optimizes the policy only using the collected actions and is sensitive to Q-values, which limits the potential for further performance enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel preferred-action-optimized diffusion policy for offline RL. In particular, an expressive conditional diffusion model is utilized to represent the diverse distribution of a behavior policy. Meanwhile, based on the diffusion model, preferred actions within the same behavior distribution are automatically generated through the critic function. Moreover, an anti-noise preference optimization is designed to achieve policy improvement by using the preferred actions, which can adapt to noise-preferred actions for stable training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method provides competitive or superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art offline RL methods, particularly in sparse reward tasks such as Kitchen and AntMaze. Additionally, we empirically prove the effectiveness of anti-noise preference optimization.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) models have achieved significant success but continue to be hampered by the slow sampling speed of their iterative sampling processes. To address the challenge, consistency models have been proposed to facilitate fast inference, albeit at the cost of sample quality. In this work, we aim to break the quality bottleneck of a video consistency model (VCM) to achieve $\textbf{both fast and high-quality video generation}$. We introduce T2V-Turbo, which integrates feedback from a mixture of differentiable reward models into the consistency distillation (CD) process of a pre-trained T2V model. Notably, we directly optimize rewards associated with single-step generations that arise naturally from computing the CD loss, effectively bypassing the memory constraints imposed by backpropagating gradients through an iterative sampling process. Remarkably, the 4-step generations from our T2V-Turbo achieve the highest total score on VBench, even surpassing Gen-2 and Pika. We further conduct human evaluations to corroborate the results, validating that the 4-step generations from our T2V-Turbo are preferred over the 50-step DDIM samples from their teacher models, representing more than a tenfold acceleration while improving video generation quality.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The current electroencephalogram (EEG) based deep learning models are typically designed for specific datasets and applications in brain-computer interaction (BCI), limiting the scale of the models and thus diminishing their perceptual capabilities and generalizability. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented success in text processing, prompting us to explore the capabilities of Large EEG Models (LEMs). We hope that LEMs can break through the limitations of different task types of EEG datasets, and obtain universal perceptual capabilities of EEG signals through unsupervised pre-training. Then the models can be fine-tuned for different downstream tasks. However, compared to text data, the volume of EEG datasets is generally small and the format varies widely. For example, there can be mismatched numbers of electrodes, unequal length data samples, varied task designs, and low signal-to-noise ratio. To overcome these challenges, we propose a unified foundation model for EEG called Large Brain Model (LaBraM). LaBraM enables cross-dataset learning by segmenting the EEG signals into EEG channel patches. Vector-quantized neural spectrum prediction is used to train a semantically rich neural tokenizer that encodes continuous raw EEG channel patches into compact neural codes. We then pre-train neural Transformers by predicting the original neural codes for the masked EEG channel patches. The LaBraMs were pre-trained on about 2,500 hours of various types of EEG signals from around 20 datasets and validated on multiple different types of downstream tasks. Experiments on abnormal detection, event type classification, emotion recognition, and gait prediction show that our LaBraM outperforms all compared SOTA methods in their respective fields.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies have revealed that vision-language (VL) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks for image-text retrieval (ITR). However, existing defense strategies for VL models primarily focus on zero-shot image classification, which do not consider the simultaneous manipulation of image and text, as well as the inherent many-to-many (N:N) nature of ITR, where a single image can be described in numerous ways, and vice versa. To this end, this paper studies defense strategies against adversarial attacks on VL models for ITR for the first time. Particularly, we focus on how to leverage the N:N relationship in ITR to enhance adversarial robustness. We found that, although adversarial training easily overfits to specific one-to-one (1:1) image-text pairs in the train data, diverse augmentation techniques to create one-to-many (1:N) / many-to-one (N:1) image-text pairs can significantly improve adversarial robustness in VL models. Additionally, we show that the alignment of the augmented image-text pairs is crucial for the effectiveness of the defense strategy, and that inappropriate augmentations can even degrade the model's performance. Based on these findings, we propose a novel defense strategy that leverages the N:N relationship in ITR, which effectively generates diverse yet highly-aligned N:N pairs using basic augmentations and generative model-based augmentations. This work provides a novel perspective on defending against adversarial attacks in VL tasks and opens up new research directions for future work.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-attention is the key mechanism of transformers, which are the essential building blocks of modern foundation models. Recent studies have shown that pure self-attention suffers from an increasing degree of rank collapse as depth increases, limiting model expressivity and further utilization of model depth. The existing literature on rank collapse, however, has mostly overlooked other critical components in transformers that may alleviate the rank collapse issue. In this paper, we provide a general analysis of rank collapse under self-attention, taking into account the effects of attention masks and layer normalization (LayerNorm). In particular, we find that although pure masked attention still suffers from exponential collapse to a rank one subspace, local masked attention can provably slow down the collapse rate. In the case of self-attention with LayerNorm, we first show that for certain classes of value matrices, collapse to a rank one subspace still happens exponentially. However, through construction of nontrivial counterexamples, we then establish that with proper choice of value matrices, a general class of sequences may not converge to a rank one subspace, and the self-attention dynamics with LayerNorm can simultaneously possess a rich set of equilibria with any possible rank between one and full. Our result refutes the previous hypothesis that LayerNorm plays no role in the rank collapse of self-attention and suggests that self-attention with LayerNorm constitutes a much more expressive, versatile nonlinear dynamical system than what was originally thought.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The scarcity of free-hand sketch presents a challenging problem. Despite the emergence of some large-scale sketch datasets, these datasets primarily consist of sketches at the single-object level. There continues to be a lack of large-scale paired datasets for scene sketches. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised method for scene sketch generation that does not rely on any existing scene sketch, enabling the transformation of single-object sketches into scene sketches. To accomplish this, we introduce a method for vector sketch captioning and sketch semantic expansion. Additionally, we design a sketch generation network that incorporates a fusion of multi-modal perceptual constraints, suitable for application in zero-shot image-to-sketch downstream task, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance through experimental validation. Finally, leveraging our proposed sketch-to-sketch generation method, we contribute a large-scale dataset centered around scene sketches, comprising highly semantically consistent "text-sketch-image" triplets. Our research confirms that this dataset can significantly enhance the capabilities of existing models in sketch-based image retrieval and sketch-controlled image synthesis tasks. We will make our dataset and code publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deciphering the human visual experience through brain activities captured by fMRI represents a compelling and cutting-edge challenge in the field of neuroscience research. Compared to merely predicting the viewed image itself, decoding brain activity into meaningful captions provides a higher-level interpretation and summarization of visual information, which naturally enhances the application flexibility in real-world situations. In this work, we introduce MindSemantix, a novel multi-modal framework that enables LLMs to comprehend visually-evoked semantic content in brain activity. Our MindSemantix explores a more ideal brain captioning paradigm by weaving LLMs into brain activity analysis, crafting a seamless, end-to-end Brain-Language Model. To effectively capture semantic information from brain responses, we propose Brain-Text Transformer, utilizing a Brain Q-Former as its core architecture. It integrates a pre-trained brain encoder with a frozen LLM to achieve multi-modal alignment of brain-vision-language and establish a robust brain-language correspondence. To enhance the generalizability of neural representations, we pre-train our brain encoder on a large-scale, cross-subject fMRI dataset using self-supervised learning techniques. MindSemantix provides more feasibility to downstream brain decoding tasks such as stimulus reconstruction. Conditioned by MindSemantix captioning, our framework facilitates this process by integrating with advanced generative models like Stable Diffusion and excels in understanding brain visual perception. MindSemantix generates high-quality captions that are deeply rooted in the visual and semantic information derived from brain activity. This approach has demonstrated substantial quantitative improvements over prior art. Our code will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative models based on flow matching have attracted significant attention for their simplicity and superior performance in high-resolution image synthesis. By leveraging the instantaneous change-of-variables formula, one can directly compute image likelihoods from a learned flow, making them enticing candidates as priors for downstream tasks such as inverse problems. In particular, a natural approach would be to incorporate such image probabilities in a maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation problem. A major obstacle, however, lies in the slow computation of the log-likelihood, as it requires backpropagating through an ODE solver, which can be prohibitively slow for high-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose an iterative algorithm to approximate the MAP estimator efficiently to solve a variety of linear inverse problems. Our algorithm is mathematically justified by the observation that the MAP objective can be approximated by a sum of $N$ ``local MAP'' objectives, where $N$ is the number of function evaluations. By leveraging Tweedie's formula, we show that we can perform gradient steps to sequentially optimize these objectives. We validate our approach for various linear inverse problems, such as super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, and compressed sensing, and demonstrate that we can outperform other methods based on flow matching.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>As interest in "reformulating" the 3D Visual Question Answering (VQA) problem in the context of foundation models grows, it is imperative to assess how these new paradigms influence existing closed-vocabulary datasets. In this case study, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of foundational models (GPT-4 Vision and GPT-4) on well-established 3D VQA benchmarks, namely 3D-VQA and ScanQA. We provide an investigation to contextualize the performance of GPT-based agents relative to traditional modeling approaches. We find that GPT-based agents without any fine-tuning perform on par with the closed vocabulary approaches. Our findings corroborate recent results that "blind" models establish a surprisingly strong baseline in closed-vocabulary settings. We demonstrate that agents benefit significantly from scene-specific vocabulary via in-context textual grounding. By presenting a preliminary comparison with previous baselines, we hope to inform the community's ongoing efforts to refine multi-modal 3D benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image is a highly ambiguous problem, as similar 2D projections can correspond to multiple 3D interpretations. Nevertheless, most HMR methods overlook this ambiguity and make a single prediction without accounting for the associated uncertainty. A few approaches generate a distribution of human meshes, enabling the sampling of multiple predictions; however, none of them is competitive with the latest single-output model when making a single prediction. This work proposes a new approach based on masked generative modeling. By tokenizing the human pose and shape, we formulate the HMR task as generating a sequence of discrete tokens conditioned on an input image. We introduce MEGA, a MaskEd Generative Autoencoder trained to recover human meshes from images and partial human mesh token sequences. Given an image, our flexible generation scheme allows us to predict a single human mesh in deterministic mode or to generate multiple human meshes in stochastic mode. MEGA enables us to propose multiple outputs and to evaluate the uncertainty of the predictions. Experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks show that MEGA achieves state-of-the-art performance in deterministic and stochastic modes, outperforming single-output and multi-output approaches.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation seeks to label each pixel in an image with arbitrary text descriptions. Vision-language foundation models, especially CLIP, have recently emerged as powerful tools for acquiring open-vocabulary capabilities. However, fine-tuning CLIP to equip it with pixel-level prediction ability often suffers three issues: 1) high computational cost, 2) misalignment between the two inherent modalities of CLIP, and 3) degraded generalization ability on unseen categories. To address these issues, we propose H-CLIP a symmetrical parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy conducted in hyperspherical space for both of the two CLIP modalities. Specifically, the PEFT strategy is achieved by a series of efficient block-diagonal learnable transformation matrices and a dual cross-relation communication module among all learnable matrices. Since the PEFT strategy is conducted symmetrically to the two CLIP modalities, the misalignment between them is mitigated. Furthermore, we apply an additional constraint to PEFT on the CLIP text encoder according to the hyperspherical energy principle, i.e., minimizing hyperspherical energy during fine-tuning preserves the intrinsic structure of the original parameter space, to prevent the destruction of the generalization ability offered by the CLIP text encoder. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks show that H-CLIP achieves new SOTA open-vocabulary semantic segmentation results while only requiring updating approximately 4% of the total parameters of CLIP.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly Detection focuses on identifying samples that deviate from the norm. When working with high-dimensional data such as images, a crucial requirement for detecting anomalous patterns is learning lower-dimensional representations that capture normal concepts seen during training. Recent advances in self-supervised learning have shown great promise in this regard. However, many of the most successful self-supervised anomaly detection methods assume prior knowledge about the structure of anomalies and leverage synthetic anomalies during training. Yet, in many real-world applications, we do not know what to expect from unseen data, and we can solely leverage knowledge about normal data. In this work, we propose Con2, which addresses this problem by setting normal training data into distinct contexts while preserving its normal properties, letting us observe the data from different perspectives. Unseen normal data consequently adheres to learned context representations while anomalies fail to do so, letting us detect them without any knowledge about anomalies during training. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks while exhibiting superior performance in a more realistic healthcare setting, where knowledge about potential anomalies is often scarce.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, we focus on the alignment problem of diffusion models with a continuous reward function, which represents specific objectives for downstream tasks, such as improving human preference. The central goal of the alignment problem is to adjust the distribution learned by diffusion models such that the generated samples maximize the target reward function. We propose a novel alignment approach, named Direct Noise Optimization (DNO), that optimizes the injected noise during the sampling process of diffusion models. By design, DNO is tuning-free and prompt-agnostic, as the alignment occurs in an online fashion during generation. We rigorously study the theoretical properties of DNO and also propose variants to deal with non-differentiable reward functions. Furthermore, we identify that naive implementation of DNO occasionally suffers from the out-of-distribution reward hacking problem, where optimized samples have high rewards but are no longer in the support of the pretrained distribution. To remedy this issue, we leverage classical high-dimensional statistics theory and propose to augment the DNO loss with certain probability regularization. We conduct extensive experiments on several popular reward functions trained on human feedback data and demonstrate that the proposed DNO approach achieves state-of-the-art reward scores as well as high image quality, all within a reasonable time budget for generation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent surge in foundation models for natural language processing and computer vision has fueled innovation across various domains. Inspired by this progress, we explore the potential of foundation models for time-series forecasting in smart agriculture, a field often plagued by limited data availability. Specifically, this work presents a novel application of $\texttt{TimeGPT}$, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) time-series foundation model, to predict soil water potential ($\psi_\mathrm{soil}$), a key indicator of field water status that is typically used for irrigation advice. Traditionally, this task relies on a wide array of input variables. We explore $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$'s ability to forecast $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ in: ($i$) a zero-shot setting, ($ii$) a fine-tuned setting relying solely on historic $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ measurements, and ($iii$) a fine-tuned setting where we also add exogenous variables to the model. We compare $\texttt{TimeGPT}$'s performance to established SOTA baseline models for forecasting $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{TimeGPT}$ achieves competitive forecasting accuracy using only historical $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ data, highlighting its remarkable potential for agricultural applications. This research paves the way for foundation time-series models for sustainable development in agriculture by enabling forecasting tasks that were traditionally reliant on extensive data collection and domain expertise.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Given the ability to model more realistic and dynamic problems, Federated Continual Learning (FCL) has been increasingly investigated recently. A well-known problem encountered in this setting is the so-called catastrophic forgetting, for which the learning model is inclined to focus on more recent tasks while forgetting the previously learned knowledge. The majority of the current approaches in FCL propose generative-based solutions to solve said problem. However, this setting requires multiple training epochs over the data, implying an offline setting where datasets are stored locally and remain unchanged over time. Furthermore, the proposed solutions are tailored for vision tasks solely. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new modality-agnostic approach to deal with the online scenario where new data arrive in streams of mini-batches that can only be processed once. To solve catastrophic forgetting, we propose an uncertainty-aware memory-based approach. In particular, we suggest using an estimator based on the Bregman Information (BI) to compute the model's variance at the sample level. Through measures of predictive uncertainty, we retrieve samples with specific characteristics, and - by retraining the model on such samples - we demonstrate the potential of this approach to reduce the forgetting effect in realistic settings.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>X.509 certificates play a crucial role in establishing secure communication over the internet by enabling authentication and data integrity. Equipped with a rich feature set, the X.509 standard is defined by multiple, comprehensive ISO/IEC documents. Due to its internet-wide usage, there are different implementations in multiple programming languages leading to a large and fragmented ecosystem. This work addresses the research question "Are there user-visible and security-related differences between X.509 certificate parsers?". Relevant libraries offering APIs for parsing X.509 certificates were investigated and an appropriate test suite was developed. From 34 libraries 6 were chosen for further analysis. The X.509 parsing modules of the chosen libraries were called with 186,576,846 different certificates from a real-world dataset and the observed error codes were investigated. This study reveals an anomaly in wolfSSL's X.509 parsing module and that there are fundamental differences in the ecosystem. While related studies nowadays mostly focus on fuzzing techniques resulting in artificial certificates, this study confirms that available X.509 parsing modules differ largely and yield different results, even for real-world out-in-the-wild certificates.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Contrastive pre-training on image-text pairs, exemplified by CLIP, becomes a standard technique for learning multi-modal visual-language representations. Although CLIP has demonstrated remarkable performance, training it from scratch on noisy web-scale datasets is computationally demanding. On the other hand, mask-then-predict pre-training approaches, like Masked Image Modeling (MIM), offer efficient self-supervised learning for single-modal representations. This paper introduces Unmasked Token Alignment (UTA), a method that leverages existing CLIP models to further enhance its vision-language representations. UTA trains a Vision Transformer (ViT) by aligning unmasked visual tokens to the corresponding image tokens from a frozen CLIP vision encoder, which automatically aligns the ViT model with the CLIP text encoder. The pre-trained ViT can be directly applied for zero-shot evaluation even without training on image-text pairs. Compared to MIM approaches, UTA does not suffer from training-finetuning inconsistency and is much more training-efficient by avoiding using the extra [MASK] tokens. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that UTA can enhance CLIP models and outperform existing MIM methods on various uni- and multi-modal benchmarks.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present Cephalo, a series of multimodal vision large language models (V-LLMs) designed for materials science applications, integrating visual and linguistic data for enhanced understanding and interaction within human-AI and multi-agent AI frameworks. A key innovation of Cephalo is its advanced dataset generation method, which employs a sophisticated algorithm to accurately detect and separate images and their corresponding textual descriptions from PDF documents, such as scientific papers. The method includes a careful refinement of image-text pairs through integrated vision and language processing, ensuring high-quality, contextually relevant, and well reasoned training data. Cephalo is trained on integrated image and text data extracted from thousands of scientific papers and science-focused Wikipedia pages demonstrates can interpret complex visual scenes, generate precise language descriptions, and answer queries about images effectively. The combination of a vision encoder with an autoregressive transformer supports complex natural language understanding in an integrated model, which can be coupled with other generative methods to create an image-to-text-to-image or image-to-text-to-3D pipeline. To explore the development of larger models from smaller ones, we merge sets of layers that originate from different pre-trained source models. This hybrid approach allows us to leverage the domain-specific expertise and general conversational capabilities to harness the strengths of multiple models. We examine the models in diverse use cases that incorporate biological materials, fracture and engineering analysis, protein biophysics, and bio-inspired design based on insect behavior. Generative applications include bio-inspired designs, including pollen-inspired architected materials, as well as the synthesis of bio-inspired material microstructures from a photograph of a solar eclipse.</li>

CHATS-CRITIC is composed of an image-to-text model to recover the table from a chart, and a tabular entailment model applied to score the summary sentence by sentence. We find that CHATS-CRITIC evaluates the summary quality according to human ratings better than reference-based metrics, either learned or n-gram based, and can be further used to fix candidate summaries by removing not supported sentences. We then introduce CHATS-PI, a chart-to-summary pipeline that leverages CHATS-CRITIC during inference to fix and rank sampled candidates from any chart-summarization model. We evaluate CHATS-PI and CHATS-CRITIC using human raters, establishing state-of-the-art results on two popular chart-to-summary datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce Poseidon, a foundation model for learning the solution operators of PDEs. It is based on a multiscale operator transformer, with time-conditioned layer norms that enable continuous-in-time evaluations. A novel training strategy leveraging the semi-group property of time-dependent PDEs to allow for significant scaling-up of the training data is also proposed. Poseidon is pretrained on a diverse, large scale dataset for the governing equations of fluid dynamics. It is then evaluated on a suite of 15 challenging downstream tasks that include a wide variety of PDE types and operators. We show that Poseidon exhibits excellent performance across the board by outperforming baselines significantly, both in terms of sample efficiency and accuracy. Poseidon also generalizes very well to new physics that is not seen during pretraining. Moreover, Poseidon scales with respect to model and data size, both for pretraining and for downstream tasks. Taken together, our results showcase the surprising ability of Poseidon to learn effective representations from a very small set of PDEs during pretraining in order to generalize well to unseen and unrelated PDEs downstream, demonstrating its potential as an effective, general purpose PDE foundation model. Finally, the Poseidon model as well as underlying pretraining and downstream datasets are open sourced, with code being available at this https URL and pretrained models and datasets at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Logical reasoning task has attracted great interest since it was proposed. Faced with such a task, current competitive models, even large language models (e.g., ChatGPT and PaLM 2), still perform badly. Previous promising LMs struggle in logical consistency modeling and logical structure perception. To this end, we model the logical reasoning task by transforming each logical sample into reasoning paths and propose an architecture \textbf{PathReasoner}. It addresses the task from the views of both data and model. To expand the diversity of the logical samples, we propose an atom extension strategy supported by equivalent logical formulas, to form new reasoning paths. From the model perspective, we design a stack of transformer-style blocks. In particular, we propose a path-attention module to joint model in-atom and cross-atom relations with the high-order diffusion strategy. Experiments show that PathReasoner achieves competitive performances on two logical reasoning benchmarks and great generalization abilities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Continual learning with deep neural networks presents challenges distinct from both the fixed-dataset and convex continual learning regimes. One such challenge is plasticity loss, wherein a neural network trained in an online fashion displays a degraded ability to fit new tasks. This problem has been extensively studied in both supervised learning and off-policy reinforcement learning (RL), where a number of remedies have been proposed. Still, plasticity loss has received less attention in the on-policy deep RL setting. Here we perform an extensive set of experiments examining plasticity loss and a variety of mitigation methods in on-policy deep RL. We demonstrate that plasticity loss is pervasive under domain shift in this regime, and that a number of methods developed to resolve it in other settings fail, sometimes even resulting in performance that is worse than performing no intervention at all. In contrast, we find that a class of ``regenerative'' methods are able to consistently mitigate plasticity loss in a variety of contexts, including in gridworld tasks and more challenging environments like Montezuma's Revenge and ProcGen.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large autoregressive models like Transformers can solve tasks through in-context learning (ICL) without learning new weights, suggesting avenues for efficiently solving new tasks. For many tasks, e.g., linear regression, the data factorizes: examples are independent given a task latent that generates the data, e.g., linear coefficients. While an optimal predictor leverages this factorization by inferring task latents, it is unclear if Transformers implicitly do so or if they instead exploit heuristics and statistical shortcuts enabled by attention layers. Both scenarios have inspired active ongoing work. In this paper, we systematically investigate the effect of explicitly inferring task latents. We minimally modify the Transformer architecture with a bottleneck designed to prevent shortcuts in favor of more structured solutions, and then compare performance against standard Transformers across various ICL tasks. Contrary to intuition and some recent works, we find little discernible difference between the two; biasing towards task-relevant latent variables does not lead to better out-of-distribution performance, in general. Curiously, we find that while the bottleneck effectively learns to extract latent task variables from context, downstream processing struggles to utilize them for robust prediction. Our study highlights the intrinsic limitations of Transformers in achieving structured ICL solutions that generalize, and shows that while inferring the right latents aids interpretability, it is not sufficient to alleviate this problem.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the great success of diffusion models (DMs) in generating realistic synthetic vision data, many researchers have investigated their potential in decision-making and control. Most of these works utilized DMs to sample directly from the trajectory space, where DMs can be viewed as a combination of dynamics models and policies. In this work, we explore how to decouple DMs' ability as dynamics models in fully offline settings, allowing the learning policy to roll out trajectories. As DMs learn the data distribution from the dataset, their intrinsic policy is actually the behavior policy induced from the dataset, which results in a mismatch between the behavior policy and the learning policy. We propose Dynamics Diffusion, short as DyDiff, which can inject information from the learning policy to DMs iteratively. DyDiff ensures long-horizon rollout accuracy while maintaining policy consistency and can be easily deployed on model-free algorithms. We provide theoretical analysis to show the advantage of DMs on long-horizon rollout over models and demonstrate the effectiveness of DyDiff in the context of offline reinforcement learning, where the rollout dataset is provided but no online environment for interaction.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation, with studies suggesting that they can generalize by composing latent factors learned from the training data. In this work, we go further and study DDPMs trained on strictly separate subsets of the data distribution with large gaps on the support of the latent factors. We show that such a model can effectively generate images in the unexplored, intermediate regions of the distribution. For instance, when trained on clearly smiling and non-smiling faces, we demonstrate a sampling procedure which can generate slightly smiling faces without reference images (zero-shot interpolation). We replicate these findings for other attributes as well as other datasets. $\href{this https URL}{\text{Our code is available on GitHub.}}$</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper aims to introduce 3D Gaussian for efficient, expressive, and editable digital avatar generation. This task faces two major challenges: (1) The unstructured nature of 3D Gaussian makes it incompatible with current generation pipelines; (2) the expressive animation of 3D Gaussian in a generative setting that involves training with multiple subjects remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel avatar generation method named $E^3$Gen, to effectively address these challenges. First, we propose a novel generative UV features plane representation that encodes unstructured 3D Gaussian onto a structured 2D UV space defined by the SMPL-X parametric model. This novel representation not only preserves the representation ability of the original 3D Gaussian but also introduces a shared structure among subjects to enable generative learning of the diffusion model. To tackle the second challenge, we propose a part-aware deformation module to achieve robust and accurate full-body expressive pose control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in avatar generation and enables expressive full-body pose control and editing.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated impressive image-generation capabilities, there are significant concerns about their potential misuse for generating unsafe content, violating copyright, and perpetuating societal biases. Recently, the text-to-image generation community has begun addressing these concerns by editing or unlearning undesired concepts from pre-trained models. However, these methods often involve data-intensive and inefficient fine-tuning or utilize various forms of token remapping, rendering them susceptible to adversarial jailbreaks. In this paper, we present a simple and effective training-free approach, ConceptPrune, wherein we first identify critical regions within pre-trained models responsible for generating undesirable concepts, thereby facilitating straightforward concept unlearning via weight pruning. Experiments across a range of concepts including artistic styles, nudity, object erasure, and gender debiasing demonstrate that target concepts can be efficiently erased by pruning a tiny fraction, approximately 0.12% of total weights, enabling multi-concept erasure and robustness against various white-box and black-box adversarial attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Sampling invariant distributions from an Ito diffusion process presents a significant challenge in stochastic simulation. Traditional numerical solvers for stochastic differential equations require both a fine step size and a lengthy simulation period, resulting in both biased and correlated samples. Current deep learning-based method solves the stationary Fokker--Planck equation to determine the invariant probability density function in form of deep neural networks, but they generally do not directly address the problem of sampling from the computed density function. In this work, we introduce a framework that employs a weak generative sampler (WGS) to directly generate independent and identically distributed (iid) samples induced by a transformation map derived from the stationary Fokker--Planck equation. Our proposed loss function is based on the weak form of the Fokker--Planck equation, integrating normalizing flows to characterize the invariant distribution and facilitate sample generation from the base distribution. Our randomized test function circumvents the need for mini-max optimization in the traditional weak formulation. Distinct from conventional generative models, our method neither necessitates the computationally intensive calculation of the Jacobian determinant nor the invertibility of the transformation map. A crucial component of our framework is the adaptively chosen family of test functions in the form of Gaussian kernel functions with centres selected from the generated data samples. Experimental results on several benchmark examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which offers both low computational costs and excellent capability in exploring multiple metastable states.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Character animation in real-world scenarios necessitates a variety of constraints, such as trajectories, key-frames, interactions, etc. Existing methodologies typically treat single or a finite set of these constraint(s) as separate control tasks. They are often specialized, and the tasks they address are rarely extendable or customizable. We categorize these as solutions to the close-set motion control problem. In response to the complexity of practical motion control, we propose and attempt to solve the open-set motion control problem. This problem is characterized by an open and fully customizable set of motion control tasks. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm, programmable motion generation. In this paradigm, any given motion control task is broken down into a combination of atomic constraints. These constraints are then programmed into an error function that quantifies the degree to which a motion sequence adheres to them. We utilize a pre-trained motion generation model and optimize its latent code to minimize the error function of the generated motion. Consequently, the generated motion not only inherits the prior of the generative model but also satisfies the required constraints. Experiments show that we can generate high-quality motions when addressing a wide range of unseen tasks. These tasks encompass motion control by motion dynamics, geometric constraints, physical laws, interactions with scenes, objects or the character own body parts, etc. All of these are achieved in a unified approach, without the need for ad-hoc paired training data collection or specialized network designs. During the programming of novel tasks, we observed the emergence of new skills beyond those of the prior model. With the assistance of large language models, we also achieved automatic programming. We hope that this work will pave the way for the motion control of general AI agents.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Real-world geometry and 3D vision tasks are replete with challenging symmetries that defy tractable analytical expression. In this paper, we introduce Neural Isometries, an autoencoder framework which learns to map the observation space to a general-purpose latent space wherein encodings are related by isometries whenever their corresponding observations are geometrically related in world space. Specifically, we regularize the latent space such that maps between encodings preserve a learned inner product and commute with a learned functional operator, in the same manner as rigid-body transformations commute with the Laplacian. This approach forms an effective backbone for self-supervised representation learning, and we demonstrate that a simple off-the-shelf equivariant network operating in the pre-trained latent space can achieve results on par with meticulously-engineered, handcrafted networks designed to handle complex, nonlinear symmetries. Furthermore, isometric maps capture information about the respective transformations in world space, and we show that this allows us to regress camera poses directly from the coefficients of the maps between encodings of adjacent views of a scene.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large language models (LLMs) often hallucinate and lack the ability to provide attribution for their generations. Semi-parametric LMs, such as kNN-LM, approach these limitations by refining the output of an LM for a given prompt using its nearest neighbor matches in a non-parametric data store. However, these models often exhibit slow inference speeds and produce non-fluent texts. In this paper, we introduce Nearest Neighbor Speculative Decoding (NEST), a novel semi-parametric language modeling approach that is capable of incorporating real-world text spans of arbitrary length into the LM generations and providing attribution to their sources. NEST performs token-level retrieval at each inference step to compute a semi-parametric mixture distribution and identify promising span continuations in a corpus. It then uses an approximate speculative decoding procedure that accepts a prefix of the retrieved span or generates a new token. NEST significantly enhances the generation quality and attribution rate of the base LM across a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks, surpassing the conventional kNN-LM method and performing competitively with in-context retrieval augmentation. In addition, NEST substantially improves the generation speed, achieving a 1.8x speedup in inference time when applied to Llama-2-Chat 70B.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we introduce a new task: Zero-Shot 3D Reasoning Segmentation for parts searching and localization for objects, which is a new paradigm to 3D segmentation that transcends limitations for previous category-specific 3D semantic segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, and open-vocabulary 3D segmentation. We design a simple baseline method, Reasoning3D, with the capability to understand and execute complex commands for (fine-grained) segmenting specific parts for 3D meshes with contextual awareness and reasoned answers for interactive segmentation. Specifically, Reasoning3D leverages an off-the-shelf pre-trained 2D segmentation network, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), to interpret user input queries in a zero-shot manner. Previous research have shown that extensive pre-training endows foundation models with prior world knowledge, enabling them to comprehend complex commands, a capability we can harness to "segment anything" in 3D with limited 3D datasets (source efficient). Experimentation reveals that our approach is generalizable and can effectively localize and highlight parts of 3D objects (in 3D mesh) based on implicit textual queries, including these articulated 3d objects and real-world scanned data. Our method can also generate natural language explanations corresponding to these 3D models and the decomposition. Moreover, our training-free approach allows rapid deployment and serves as a viable universal baseline for future research of part-level 3d (semantic) object understanding in various fields including robotics, object manipulation, part assembly, autonomous driving applications, augment reality and virtual reality (AR/VR), and medical applications.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Most multi-modal tasks can be formulated into problems of either generation or embedding. Existing models usually tackle these two types of problems by decoupling language modules into a text decoder for generation, and a text encoder for embedding. To explore the minimalism of multi-modal paradigms, we attempt to achieve only one model per modality in this work. We propose a Multi-Modal Generative Embedding Model (MM-GEM), whereby the generative and embedding objectives are encapsulated in one Large Language Model. We also propose a PoolAggregator to boost efficiency and enable the ability of fine-grained embedding and generation. A surprising finding is that these two objectives do not significantly conflict with each other. For example, MM-GEM instantiated from ViT-Large and TinyLlama shows competitive performance on benchmarks for multimodal embedding models such as cross-modal retrieval and zero-shot classification, while has good ability of image captioning. Additionally, MM-GEM can seamlessly execute region-level image caption generation and retrieval tasks. Besides, the advanced text model in MM-GEM brings over 5% improvement in Recall@1 for long text and image retrieval.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce X-VILA, an omni-modality model designed to extend the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating image, video, and audio modalities. By aligning modality-specific encoders with LLM inputs and diffusion decoders with LLM outputs, X-VILA achieves cross-modality understanding, reasoning, and generation. To facilitate this cross-modality alignment, we curate an effective interleaved any-to-any modality instruction-following dataset. Furthermore, we identify a significant problem with the current cross-modality alignment method, which results in visual information loss. To address the issue, we propose a visual alignment mechanism with a visual embedding highway module. We then introduce a resource-efficient recipe for training X-VILA, that exhibits proficiency in any-to-any modality conversation, surpassing previous approaches by large margins. X-VILA also showcases emergent properties across modalities even in the absence of similar training data. The project will be made open-source.</li>
