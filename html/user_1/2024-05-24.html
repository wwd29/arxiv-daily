<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigms can use external knowledge to enhance and ground the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate generative hallucinations and static knowledge base problems, they still suffer from limited flexibility in adopting Information Retrieval (IR) systems with varying capabilities, constrained interpretability during the multi-round retrieval process, and a lack of end-to-end optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-centric approach, IM-RAG, that integrates IR systems with LLMs to support multi-round RAG through learning Inner Monologues (IM, i.e., the human inner voice that narrates one's thoughts). During the IM process, the LLM serves as the core reasoning model (i.e., Reasoner) to either propose queries to collect more information via the Retriever or to provide a final answer based on the conversational context. We also introduce a Refiner that improves the outputs from the Retriever, effectively bridging the gap between the Reasoner and IR modules with varying capabilities and fostering multi-round communications. The entire IM process is optimized via Reinforcement Learning (RL) where a Progress Tracker is incorporated to provide mid-step rewards, and the answer prediction is further separately optimized via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We conduct extensive experiments with the HotPotQA dataset, a popular benchmark for retrieval-based, multi-step question-answering. The results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while providing high flexibility in integrating IR modules as well as strong interpretability exhibited in the learned inner monologues.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning from human feedback has shown success in aligning large, pretrained models with human values. Prior works have mostly focused on learning from high-level labels, such as preferences between pairs of model outputs. On the other hand, many domains could benefit from more involved, detailed feedback, such as revisions, explanations, and reasoning of human users. Our work proposes using nuanced feedback through the form of human revisions for stronger alignment. In this paper, we ask expert designers to fix layouts generated from a generative layout model that is pretrained on a large-scale dataset of mobile screens. Then, we train a reward model based on how human designers revise these generated layouts. With the learned reward model, we optimize our model with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Our method, Revision-Aware Reward Models ($\method$), allows a generative text-to-layout model to produce more modern, designer-aligned layouts, showing the potential for utilizing human revisions and stronger forms of feedback in improving generative models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this work, a robust autoencoder ensemble-based approach designed to address anomaly detection in text corpora is introduced. Each autoencoder within the ensemble incorporates a local robust subspace recovery projection of the original data in its encoding embedding, leveraging the geometric properties of the k-nearest neighbors to optimize subspace recovery and identify anomalous patterns in textual data. The evaluation of such an approach needs an experimental setting dedicated to the context of textual anomaly detection. Thus, beforehand, a comprehensive real-world taxonomy is introduced to distinguish between independent anomalies and contextual anomalies. Such a study to identify clearly the kinds of anomalies appearing in a textual context aims at addressing a critical gap in the existing literature. Then, extensive experiments on classical text corpora have been conducted and their results are presented that highlights the efficiency, both in robustness and in performance, of the robust autoencoder ensemble-based approach when detecting both independent and contextual anomalies. Diverse range of tasks, including classification, sentiment analysis, and spam detection, across eight different corpora, have been studied in these experiments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multivariant time series (MTS) data are usually incomplete in real scenarios, and imputing the incomplete MTS is practically important to facilitate various time series mining tasks. Recently, diffusion model-based MTS imputation methods have achieved promising results by utilizing CNN or attention mechanisms for temporal feature learning. However, it is hard to adaptively trade off the diverse effects of local and global temporal features by simply combining CNN and attention. To address this issue, we propose a Score-weighted Convolutional Diffusion Model (Score-CDM for short), whose backbone consists of a Score-weighted Convolution Module (SCM) and an Adaptive Reception Module (ARM). SCM adopts a score map to capture the global temporal features in the time domain, while ARM uses a Spectral2Time Window Block (S2TWB) to convolve the local time series data in the spectral domain. Benefiting from the time convolution properties of Fast Fourier Transformation, ARM can adaptively change the receptive field of the score map, and thus effectively balance the local and global temporal features. We conduct extensive evaluations on three real MTS datasets of different domains, and the result verifies the effectiveness of the proposed Score-CDM.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Federated self-supervised learning (FSSL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm that enables the exploitation of clients' vast amounts of unlabeled data while preserving data privacy. While FSSL offers advantages, its susceptibility to backdoor attacks, a concern identified in traditional federated supervised learning (FSL), has not been investigated. To fill the research gap, we undertake a comprehensive investigation into a backdoor attack paradigm, where unscrupulous clients conspire to manipulate the global model, revealing the vulnerability of FSSL to such attacks. In FSL, backdoor attacks typically build a direct association between the backdoor trigger and the target label. In contrast, in FSSL, backdoor attacks aim to alter the global model's representation for images containing the attacker's specified trigger pattern in favor of the attacker's intended target class, which is less straightforward. In this sense, we demonstrate that existing defenses are insufficient to mitigate the investigated backdoor attacks in FSSL, thus finding an effective defense mechanism is urgent. To tackle this issue, we dive into the fundamental mechanism of backdoor attacks on FSSL, proposing the Embedding Inspector (EmInspector) that detects malicious clients by inspecting the embedding space of local models. In particular, EmInspector assesses the similarity of embeddings from different local models using a small set of inspection images (e.g., ten images of CIFAR100) without specific requirements on sample distribution or labels. We discover that embeddings from backdoored models tend to cluster together in the embedding space for a given inspection image. Evaluation results show that EmInspector can effectively mitigate backdoor attacks on FSSL across various adversary settings. Our code is avaliable at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent years have witnessed an increasing global population affected by neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), which traditionally require extensive healthcare resources and human effort for medical diagnosis and monitoring. As a crucial disease-related motor symptom, human gait can be exploited to characterize different NDs. The current advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models enable automatic gait analysis for NDs identification and classification, opening a new avenue to facilitate faster and more cost-effective diagnosis of NDs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent progress of machine learning and deep learning based AI techniques applied to diagnosis of five typical NDs through gait. We provide an overview of the process of AI-assisted NDs diagnosis, and present a systematic taxonomy of existing gait data and AI models. Through an extensive review and analysis of 164 studies, we identify and discuss the challenges, potential solutions, and future directions in this field. Finally, we envision the prospective utilization of 3D skeleton data for human gait representation and the development of more efficient AI models for NDs diagnosis. We provide a public resource repository to track and facilitate developments in this emerging field: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In the domain of large language models (LLMs), arXiv:2305.16938 showed that few-shot full-model fine-tuning -- namely Vanilla Fine Tuning (FT) and Pattern-Based Fine Tuning (PBFT) --, and In-Context Learning (ICL) generalize similarly on Out-Of-Domain (OOD) datasets, but vary in terms of task adaptation. However, they both pose challenges, especially in term of memory requirements. In this paper, we further try to push the understanding of different fine-tuning strategies for LLM and aim to bring a myriad of these on the same pedestal for an elaborate comparison with full-model fine-tuning on two diverse datasets. To that end, we conducted a series of experiments, beginning with state-of-the-art methods like vanilla fine-tuning and Pattern-Based Fine-Tuning (PBFT) on pre-trained models across two datasets, COLA and MNLI. We then investigate adaptive fine-tuning and the efficiency of LoRA adapters in a few-shot setting. Finally, we also compare an alternative approach that has gained recent popularity -- context distillation -- with the vanilla FT and PBFT with and without few-shot setup. Our findings suggest that these alternative strategies that we explored can exhibit out-of-domain generalization comparable to that of vanilla FT and PBFT. PBFT under-performs Vanilla FT on out-of-domain (OOD) data, emphasizing the need for effective prompts. Further, our adaptive-fine tuning and LoRA experiments perform comparable or slightly worse than the standard fine-tunings as anticipated, since standard fine-tunings involve tuning the entire model. Finally, our context distillation experiments out-perform the standard fine-tuning methods. These findings underscore that eventually the choice of an appropriate fine-tuning method depends on the available resources (memory, compute, data) and task adaptability.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We extend multimodal transformers to include 3D camera motion as a conditioning signal for the task of video generation. Generative video models are becoming increasingly powerful, thus focusing research efforts on methods of controlling the output of such models. We propose to add virtual 3D camera controls to generative video methods by conditioning generated video on an encoding of three-dimensional camera movement over the course of the generated video. Results demonstrate that we are (1) able to successfully control the camera during video generation, starting from a single frame and a camera signal, and (2) we demonstrate the accuracy of the generated 3D camera paths using traditional computer vision methods.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Nearly every recent image synthesis approach, including diffusion, masked-token prediction, and next-token prediction, uses a Transformer network architecture. Despite this common backbone, there has been no direct, compute controlled comparison of how these approaches affect performance and efficiency. We analyze the scalability of each approach through the lens of compute budget measured in FLOPs. We find that token prediction methods, led by next-token prediction, significantly outperform diffusion on prompt following. On image quality, while next-token prediction initially performs better, scaling trends suggest it is eventually matched by diffusion. We compare the inference compute efficiency of each approach and find that next token prediction is by far the most efficient. Based on our findings we recommend diffusion for applications targeting image quality and low latency; and next-token prediction when prompt following or throughput is more important.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With rapid urbanisation and the accompanying increase in traffic density, traffic noise has become a major concern in urban planning. However, traditional grid noise mapping methods have limitations in terms of time consumption, software costs, and a lack of parameter integration interfaces. These limitations hinder their ability to meet the need for iterative updates and rapid performance feedback in the early design stages of street-scale urban planning. Herein, we developed a rapid urban traffic noise mapping technique that leverages generative adversarial networks (GANs) as a surrogate model. This approach enables the rapid assessment of urban traffic noise distribution by using urban elements such as roads and buildings as the input. The mean values for the mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index (SSIM) are 0.0949 and 0.8528, respectively, for the validation dataset. Hence, our prediction accuracy is on par with that of conventional prediction software. Furthermore, the trained model is integrated into Grasshopper as a tool, facilitating the rapid generation of traffic noise maps. This integration allows urban designers and planners, even those without expertise in acoustics, to easily anticipate changes in acoustics impacts caused by design.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The intersection of Astronomy and AI encounters significant challenges related to issues such as noisy backgrounds, lower resolution (LR), and the intricate process of filtering and archiving images from advanced telescopes like the James Webb. Given the dispersion of raw images in feature space, we have proposed a \textit{two-stage augmentation framework} entitled as \textbf{FLARE} based on \underline{f}eature \underline{l}earning and \underline{a}ugmented \underline{r}esolution \underline{e}nhancement. We first apply lower (LR) to higher resolution (HR) conversion followed by standard augmentations. Secondly, we integrate a diffusion approach to synthetically generate samples using class-concatenated prompts. By merging these two stages using weighted percentiles, we realign the feature space distribution, enabling a classification model to establish a distinct decision boundary and achieve superior generalization on various in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. We conducted experiments on several downstream cosmos datasets and on our optimally distributed \textbf{SpaceNet} dataset across 8-class fine-grained and 4-class macro classification tasks. FLARE attains the highest performance gain of 20.78\% for fine-grained tasks compared to similar baselines, while across different classification models, FLARE shows a consistent increment of an average of +15\%. This outcome underscores the effectiveness of the FLARE method in enhancing the precision of image classification, ultimately bolstering the reliability of astronomical research outcomes. % Our code and SpaceNet dataset will be released to the public soon.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Non-autoregressive Transformers (NATs) are recently applied in direct speech-to-speech translation systems, which convert speech across different languages without intermediate text data. Although NATs generate high-quality outputs and offer faster inference than autoregressive models, they tend to produce incoherent and repetitive results due to complex data distribution (e.g., acoustic and linguistic variations in speech). In this work, we introduce DiffNorm, a diffusion-based normalization strategy that simplifies data distributions for training NAT models. After training with a self-supervised noise estimation objective, DiffNorm constructs normalized target data by denoising synthetically corrupted speech features. Additionally, we propose to regularize NATs with classifier-free guidance, improving model robustness and translation quality by randomly dropping out source information during training. Our strategies result in a notable improvement of about +7 ASR-BLEU for English-Spanish (En-Es) and +2 ASR-BLEU for English-French (En-Fr) translations on the CVSS benchmark, while attaining over 14x speedup for En-Es and 5x speedup for En-Fr translations compared to autoregressive baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Virtual staining streamlines traditional staining procedures by digitally generating stained images from unstained or differently stained images. While conventional staining methods involve time-consuming chemical processes, virtual staining offers an efficient and low infrastructure alternative. Leveraging microscopy-based techniques, such as confocal microscopy, researchers can expedite tissue analysis without the need for physical sectioning. However, interpreting grayscale or pseudo-color microscopic images remains a challenge for pathologists and surgeons accustomed to traditional histologically stained images. To fill this gap, various studies explore digitally simulating staining to mimic targeted histological stains. This paper introduces a novel network, In-and-Out Net, specifically designed for virtual staining tasks. Based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), our model efficiently transforms Reflectance Confocal Microscopy (RCM) images into Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images. We enhance nuclei contrast in RCM images using aluminum chloride preprocessing for skin tissues. Training the model with virtual H\&E labels featuring two fluorescence channels eliminates the need for image registration and provides pixel-level ground truth. Our contributions include proposing an optimal training strategy, conducting a comparative analysis demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, validating the model through an ablation study, and collecting perfectly matched input and ground truth images without registration. In-and-Out Net showcases promising results, offering a valuable tool for virtual staining tasks and advancing the field of histological image analysis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) severely impairs patients' ability to communicate, often leading to a decline in their quality of life within a few years of diagnosis. The P300 speller brain-computer interface (BCI) offers an alternative communication method by interpreting a subject's EEG response to characters presented on a grid interface. This paper addresses the common speed limitations encountered in training efficient P300-based multi-subject classifiers by introducing innovative "across-subject" classifiers. We leverage a combination of the second-generation Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT2) and Dijkstra's algorithm to optimize stimuli and suggest word completion choices based on typing history. Additionally, we employ a multi-layered smoothing technique to accommodate out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. Through extensive simulations involving random sampling of EEG data from subjects, we demonstrate significant speed enhancements in typing passages containing rare and OOV words. These optimizations result in approximately 10% improvement in character-level typing speed and up to 40% improvement in multi-word prediction. We demonstrate that augmenting standard row/column highlighting techniques with layered word prediction yields close-to-optimal performance. Furthermore, we explore both "within-subject" and "across-subject" training techniques, showing that speed improvements are consistent across both approaches.</li>

          How to Trace Latent Generative Model Generated Images without Artificial Watermark?(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Latent generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) have become more and more popular, but concerns have arisen regarding potential misuse related to images generated by these models. It is, therefore, necessary to analyze the origin of images by inferring if a particular image was generated by a specific latent generative model. Most existing methods (e.g., image watermark and model fingerprinting) require extra steps during training or generation. These requirements restrict their usage on the generated images without such extra operations, and the extra required operations might compromise the quality of the generated images. In this work, we ask whether it is possible to effectively and efficiently trace the images generated by a specific latent generative model without the aforementioned requirements. To study this problem, we design a latent inversion based method called LatentTracer to trace the generated images of the inspected model by checking if the examined images can be well-reconstructed with an inverted latent input. We leverage gradient based latent inversion and identify a encoder-based initialization critical to the success of our approach. Our experiments on the state-of-the-art latent generative models, such as Stable Diffusion, show that our method can distinguish the images generated by the inspected model and other images with a high accuracy and efficiency. Our findings suggest the intriguing possibility that today's latent generative generated images are naturally watermarked by the decoder used in the source models. Code: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recently introduced TabPFN pretrains an In-Context Learning (ICL) transformer on synthetic data to perform tabular data classification. As synthetic data does not share features or labels with real-world data, the underlying mechanism that contributes to the success of this method remains unclear. This study provides an explanation by demonstrating that ICL-transformers acquire the ability to create complex decision boundaries during pretraining. To validate our claim, we develop a novel forest dataset generator which creates datasets that are unrealistic, but have complex decision boundaries. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of ICL-transformers pretrained on this data. Furthermore, we create TabForestPFN, the ICL-transformer pretrained on both the original TabPFN synthetic dataset generator and our forest dataset generator. By fine-tuning this model, we reach the current state-of-the-art on tabular data classification. Code is available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Computer aided diagnosis systems can provide non-invasive, low-cost tools to support clinicians. These systems have the potential to assist the diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders, in particular Parkinson's disease (PD). Handwriting plays a special role in the context of PD assessment. In this paper, the discriminating power of "dynamically enhanced" static images of handwriting is investigated. The enhanced images are synthetically generated by exploiting simultaneously the static and dynamic properties of handwriting. Specifically, we propose a static representation that embeds dynamic information based on: (i) drawing the points of the samples, instead of linking them, so as to retain temporal/velocity information; and (ii) adding pen-ups for the same purpose. To evaluate the effectiveness of the new handwriting representation, a fair comparison between this approach and state-of-the-art methods based on static and dynamic handwriting is conducted on the same dataset, i.e. PaHaW. The classification workflow employs transfer learning to extract meaningful features from multiple representations of the input data. An ensemble of different classifiers is used to achieve the final predictions. Dynamically enhanced static handwriting is able to outperform the results obtained by using static and dynamic handwriting separately.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-rewarding have emerged recently as a powerful tool in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), allowing language models to generate high-quality relevant responses by providing their own rewards during training. This innovative technique addresses the limitations of other methods that rely on human preferences. In this paper, we build upon the concept of self-rewarding models and introduce its vision equivalent for Text-to-Image generative AI models. This approach works by fine-tuning diffusion model on a self-generated self-judged dataset, making the fine-tuning more automated and with better data quality. The proposed mechanism makes use of other pre-trained models such as vocabulary based-object detection, image captioning and is conditioned by the a set of object for which the user might need to improve generated data quality. The approach has been implemented, fine-tuned and evaluated on stable diffusion and has led to a performance that has been evaluated to be at least 60\% better than existing commercial and research Text-to-image models. Additionally, the built self-rewarding mechanism allowed a fully automated generation of images, while increasing the visual quality of the generated images and also more efficient following of prompt instructions.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we present the Directly Denoising Diffusion Model (DDDM): a simple and generic approach for generating realistic images with few-step sampling, while multistep sampling is still preserved for better performance. DDDMs require no delicately designed samplers nor distillation on pre-trained distillation models. DDDMs train the diffusion model conditioned on an estimated target that was generated from previous training iterations of its own. To generate images, samples generated from the previous time step are also taken into consideration, guiding the generation process iteratively. We further propose Pseudo-LPIPS, a novel metric loss that is more robust to various values of hyperparameter. Despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can achieve strong performance in benchmark datasets. Our model achieves FID scores of 2.57 and 2.33 on CIFAR-10 in one-step and two-step sampling respectively, surpassing those obtained from GANs and distillation-based models. By extending the sampling to 1000 steps, we further reduce FID score to 1.79, aligning with state-of-the-art methods in the literature. For ImageNet 64x64, our approach stands as a competitive contender against leading models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating videos with realistic and physically plausible motion is one of the main recent challenges in computer vision. While diffusion models are achieving compelling results in image generation, video diffusion models are limited by heavy training and huge models, resulting in videos that are still biased to the training dataset. In this work we propose MotionCraft, a new zero-shot video generator to craft physics-based and realistic videos. MotionCraft is able to warp the noise latent space of an image diffusion model, such as Stable Diffusion, by applying an optical flow derived from a physics simulation. We show that warping the noise latent space results in coherent application of the desired motion while allowing the model to generate missing elements consistent with the scene evolution, which would otherwise result in artefacts or missing content if the flow was applied in the pixel space. We compare our method with the state-of-the-art Text2Video-Zero reporting qualitative and quantitative improvements, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach to generate videos with finely-prescribed complex motion dynamics.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent advancement of generative foundational models has ushered in a new era of image generation in the realm of natural images, revolutionizing art design, entertainment, environment simulation, and beyond. Despite producing high-quality samples, existing methods are constrained to generating images of scenes at a limited scale. In this paper, we present MetaEarth, a generative foundation model that breaks the barrier by scaling image generation to a global level, exploring the creation of worldwide, multi-resolution, unbounded, and virtually limitless remote sensing images. In MetaEarth, we propose a resolution-guided self-cascading generative framework, which enables the generating of images at any region with a wide range of geographical resolutions. To achieve unbounded and arbitrary-sized image generation, we design a novel noise sampling strategy for denoising diffusion models by analyzing the generation conditions and initial noise. To train MetaEarth, we construct a large dataset comprising multi-resolution optical remote sensing images with geographical information. Experiments have demonstrated the powerful capabilities of our method in generating global-scale images. Additionally, the MetaEarth serves as a data engine that can provide high-quality and rich training data for downstream tasks. Our model opens up new possibilities for constructing generative world models by simulating Earth visuals from an innovative overhead perspective.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies of multi-modal Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) based on point clouds and RGB images indicated the importance of exploiting redundancy and complementarity among modalities for accurate classification and segmentation. However, achieving multi-modal IAD in practical production lines remains a work in progress that requires consideration of the trade-offs between costs and benefits associated with introducing new modalities, while ensuring compatibility with current processes. Combining fast in-line inspections with high-resolution, time-consuming, near-line characterization techniques to enhance detection accuracy fits well into the existing quality control process, but only part of the samples can be tested with expensive near-line methods. Thus, the model must have the ability to leverage multi-modal training and handle incomplete modalities during inference. One solution is generating cross-modal hallucination to transfer knowledge among modalities for missing modality issues. In this paper, we propose CMDIAD, a Cross-Modal Distillation framework for IAD to demonstrate the feasibility of Multi-modal Training, Few-modal Inference pipeline. Moreover, we investigate reasons behind the asymmetric performance improvement using point clouds or RGB images as main modality of inference. This lays the foundation of our future multi-modal dataset construction for efficient IAD from manufacturing scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To assist IT service developers and operators in managing their increasingly complex service landscapes, there is a growing effort to leverage artificial intelligence in operations. To speed up troubleshooting, log anomaly detection has received much attention in particular, dealing with the identification of log events that indicate the reasons for a system failure. However, faults often propagate extensively within systems, which can result in a large number of anomalies being detected by existing approaches. In this case, it can remain very challenging for users to quickly identify the actual root cause of a failure. We propose LogRCA, a novel method for identifying a minimal set of log lines that together describe a root cause. LogRCA uses a semi-supervised learning approach to deal with rare and unknown errors and is designed to handle noisy data. We evaluated our approach on a large-scale production log data set of 44.3 million log lines, which contains 80 failures, whose root causes were labeled by experts. LogRCA consistently outperforms baselines based on deep learning and statistical analysis in terms of precision and recall to detect candidate root causes. In addition, we investigated the impact of our deployed data balancing approach, demonstrating that it considerably improves performance on rare failures.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on three benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective method of finding reasoning pathways in incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). To overcome the challenges of a large action space, a self-supervised pre-training method is proposed to warm up the policy network before the RL training stage. To alleviate the distributional mismatch issue in general self-supervised RL (SSRL), in our supervised learning (SL) stage, the agent selects actions based on the policy network and learns from generated labels; this self-generation of labels is the intuition behind the name self-supervised. With this training framework, the information density of our SL objective is increased and the agent is prevented from getting stuck with the early rewarded paths. Our self-supervised RL (SSRL) method improves the performance of RL by pairing it with the wide coverage achieved by SL during pretraining, since the breadth of the SL objective makes it infeasible to train an agent with that alone. We show that our SSRL model meets or exceeds current state-of-the-art results on all Hits@k and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) metrics on four large benchmark KG datasets. This SSRL method can be used as a plug-in for any RL architecture for a KGR task. We adopt two RL architectures, i.e., MINERVA and MultiHopKG as our baseline RL models and experimentally show that our SSRL model consistently outperforms both baselines on all of these four KG reasoning tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multimodal foundation models are prone to hallucination, generating outputs that either contradict the input or are not grounded by factual information. Given the diversity in architectures, training data and instruction tuning techniques, there can be large variations in systems' susceptibility to hallucinations. To assess system hallucination robustness, hallucination ranking approaches have been developed for specific tasks such as image captioning, question answering, summarization, or biography generation. However, these approaches typically compare model outputs to gold-standard references or labels, limiting hallucination benchmarking for new domains. This work proposes "CrossCheckGPT", a reference-free universal hallucination ranking for multimodal foundation models. The core idea of CrossCheckGPT is that the same hallucinated content is unlikely to be generated by different independent systems, hence cross-system consistency can provide meaningful and accurate hallucination assessment scores. CrossCheckGPT can be applied to any model or task, provided that the information consistency between outputs can be measured through an appropriate distance metric. Focusing on multimodal large language models that generate text, we explore two information consistency measures: CrossCheck-explicit and CrossCheck-implicit. We showcase the applicability of our method for hallucination ranking across various modalities, namely the text, image, and audio-visual domains. Further, we propose the first audio-visual hallucination benchmark, "AVHalluBench", and illustrate the effectiveness of CrossCheckGPT, achieving correlations of 98% and 89% with human judgements on MHaluBench and AVHalluBench, respectively.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce a novel approach for prompt mixing, aiming to generate images at the intersection of multiple text prompts using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. At each time step during diffusion denoising, our algorithm forecasts predictions w.r.t. the generated image and makes informed text conditioning decisions. To do so, we leverage the connection between diffusion models (rooted in non-equilibrium thermodynamics) and the Black-Scholes model for pricing options in Finance, and draw analogies between the variables in both contexts to derive an appropriate algorithm for prompt mixing using the Black Scholes model. Specifically, the parallels between diffusion models and the Black-Scholes model enable us to leverage properties related to the dynamics of the Markovian model derived in the Black-Scholes algorithm. Our prompt-mixing algorithm is data-efficient, meaning it does not need additional training. Furthermore, it operates without human intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We highlight the benefits of our approach by comparing it qualitatively and quantitatively to other prompt mixing techniques, including linear interpolation, alternating prompts, step-wise prompt switching, and CLIP-guided prompt selection across various scenarios such as single object per text prompt, multiple objects per text prompt and objects against backgrounds.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformer-based neural networks, empowered by Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), have demonstrated unprecedented performance across various domains. However, related literature suggests that tabular Transformers may struggle to outperform classical Machine Learning algorithms, such as Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT). In this paper, we aim to challenge GBDTs with tabular Transformers on a typical task faced in e-commerce, namely fraud detection. Our study is additionally motivated by the problem of selection bias, often occurring in real-life fraud detection systems. It is caused by the production system affecting which subset of traffic becomes labeled. This issue is typically addressed by sampling randomly a small part of the whole production data, referred to as a Control Group. This subset follows a target distribution of production data and therefore is usually preferred for training classification models with standard ML algorithms. Our methodology leverages the capabilities of Transformers to learn transferable representations using all available data by means of SSL, giving it an advantage over classical methods. Furthermore, we conduct large-scale experiments, pre-training tabular Transformers on vast amounts of data instances and fine-tuning them on smaller target datasets. The proposed approach outperforms heavily tuned GBDTs by a considerable margin of the Average Precision (AP) score. Pre-trained models show more consistent performance than the ones trained from scratch when fine-tuning data is limited. Moreover, they require noticeably less labeled data for reaching performance comparable to their GBDT competitor that utilizes the whole dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Anomaly detection is the task of identifying examples that do not behave as expected. Because anomalies are rare and unexpected events, collecting real anomalous examples is often challenging in several applications. In addition, learning an anomaly detector with limited (or no) anomalies often yields poor prediction performance. One option is to employ auxiliary synthetic anomalies to improve the model training. However, synthetic anomalies may be of poor quality: anomalies that are unrealistic or indistinguishable from normal samples may deteriorate the detector's performance. Unfortunately, no existing methods quantify the quality of auxiliary anomalies. We fill in this gap and propose the expected anomaly posterior (EAP), an uncertainty-based score function that measures the quality of auxiliary anomalies by quantifying the total uncertainty of an anomaly detector. Experimentally on 40 benchmark datasets of images and tabular data, we show that EAP outperforms 12 adapted data quality estimators in the majority of cases.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accuracy and speed are critical in image editing tasks. Pan et al. introduced a drag-based image editing framework that achieves pixel-level control using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). A flurry of subsequent studies enhanced this framework's generality by leveraging large-scale diffusion models. However, these methods often suffer from inordinately long processing times (exceeding 1 minute per edit) and low success rates. Addressing these issues head on, we present InstaDrag, a rapid approach enabling high quality drag-based image editing in ~1 second. Unlike most previous methods, we redefine drag-based editing as a conditional generation task, eliminating the need for time-consuming latent optimization or gradient-based guidance during inference. In addition, the design of our pipeline allows us to train our model on large-scale paired video frames, which contain rich motion information such as object translations, changing poses and orientations, zooming in and out, etc. By learning from videos, our approach can significantly outperform previous methods in terms of accuracy and consistency. Despite being trained solely on videos, our model generalizes well to perform local shape deformations not presented in the training data (e.g., lengthening of hair, twisting rainbows, etc.). Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on benchmark datasets corroborate the superiority of our approach. The code and model will be released at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Score-based generative models have demonstrated significant practical success in data-generating tasks. The models establish a diffusion process that perturbs the ground truth data to Gaussian noise and then learn the reverse process to transform noise into data. However, existing denoising methods such as Langevin dynamic and numerical stochastic differential equation solvers enjoy randomness but generate data slowly with a large number of score function evaluations, and the ordinary differential equation solvers enjoy faster sampling speed but no randomness may influence the sample quality. To this end, motivated by the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization methods and the high connection between the model sampling process with the SGD, we propose adaptive momentum sampling to accelerate the transforming process without introducing additional hyperparameters. Theoretically, we proved our method promises convergence under given conditions. In addition, we empirically show that our sampler can produce more faithful images/graphs in small sampling steps with 2 to 5 times speed up and obtain competitive scores compared to the baselines on image and graph generation tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we study an under-explored but important factor of diffusion generative models, i.e., the combinatorial complexity. Data samples are generally high-dimensional, and for various structured generation tasks, there are additional attributes which are combined to associate with data samples. We show that the space spanned by the combination of dimensions and attributes is insufficiently sampled by existing training scheme of diffusion generative models, causing degraded test time performance. We present a simple fix to this problem by constructing stochastic processes that fully exploit the combinatorial structures, hence the name ComboStoc. Using this simple strategy, we show that network training is significantly accelerated across diverse data modalities, including images and 3D structured shapes. Moreover, ComboStoc enables a new way of test time generation which uses insynchronized time steps for different dimensions and attributes, thus allowing for varying degrees of control over them.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Quadrilateral mesh generation plays a crucial role in numerical simulations within Computer-Aided Design and Engineering (CAD/E). The quality of the cross field is essential for generating a quadrilateral mesh. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised neural representation of the cross field, named NeurCross, comprising two modules: one to fit the signed distance function (SDF) and another to predict the cross field. Unlike most existing approaches that operate directly on the given polygonal surface, NeurCross takes the SDF as a bridge to allow for SDF overfitting and the prediction of the cross field to proceed simultaneously. By utilizing a neural SDF, we achieve a smooth representation of the base surface, minimizing the impact of piecewise planar discretization and minor surface variations. Moreover, the principal curvatures and directions are fully encoded by the Hessian of the SDF, enabling the regularization of the overall cross field through minor adjustments to the SDF. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, NeurCross significantly improves the placement of singular points and the approximation accuracy between the input triangular surface and the output quad mesh, as demonstrated in the teaser figure.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training diffusion models for audiovisual sequences allows for a range of generation tasks by learning conditional distributions of various input-output combinations of the two modalities. Nevertheless, this strategy often requires training a separate model for each task which is expensive. Here, we propose a novel training approach to effectively learn arbitrary conditional distributions in the audiovisual space.Our key contribution lies in how we parameterize the diffusion timestep in the forward diffusion process. Instead of the standard fixed diffusion timestep, we propose applying variable diffusion timesteps across the temporal dimension and across modalities of the inputs. This formulation offers flexibility to introduce variable noise levels for various portions of the input, hence the term mixture of noise levels. We propose a transformer-based audiovisual latent diffusion model and show that it can be trained in a task-agnostic fashion using our approach to enable a variety of audiovisual generation tasks at inference time. Experiments demonstrate the versatility of our method in tackling cross-modal and multimodal interpolation tasks in the audiovisual space. Notably, our proposed approach surpasses baselines in generating temporally and perceptually consistent samples conditioned on the input. Project page: this http URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a simple and efficient method to leverage emerging text-to-image generative models in creating large-scale synthetic supervision for the task of damage assessment from aerial images. While significant recent advances have resulted in improved techniques for damage assessment using aerial or satellite imagery, they still suffer from poor robustness to domains where manual labeled data is unavailable, directly impacting post-disaster humanitarian assistance in such under-resourced geographies. Our contribution towards improving domain robustness in this scenario is two-fold. Firstly, we leverage the text-guided mask-based image editing capabilities of generative models and build an efficient and easily scalable pipeline to generate thousands of post-disaster images from low-resource domains. Secondly, we propose a simple two-stage training approach to train robust models while using manual supervision from different source domains along with the generated synthetic target domain data. We validate the strength of our proposed framework under cross-geography domain transfer setting from xBD and SKAI images in both single-source and multi-source settings, achieving significant improvements over a source-only baseline in each case.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose a new asymptotic equipartition property for the perplexity of a large piece of text generated by a language model and present theoretical arguments for this property. Perplexity, defined as a inverse likelihood function, is widely used as a performance metric for training language models. Our main result states that the logarithmic perplexity of any large text produced by a language model must asymptotically converge to the average entropy of its token distributions. This means that language models are constrained to only produce outputs from a ``typical set", which we show, is a vanishingly small subset of all possible grammatically correct outputs. We present preliminary experimental results from an open-source language model to support our theoretical claims. This work has possible practical applications for understanding and improving ``AI detection" tools and theoretical implications for the uniqueness, predictability and creative potential of generative models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The expanding research on manifold-based self-supervised learning (SSL) builds on the manifold hypothesis, which suggests that the inherent complexity of high-dimensional data can be unraveled through lower-dimensional manifold embeddings. Capitalizing on this, DeepInfomax with an unbalanced atlas (DIM-UA) has emerged as a powerful tool and yielded impressive results for state representations in reinforcement learning. Meanwhile, Maximum Manifold Capacity Representation (MMCR) presents a new frontier for SSL by optimizing class separability via manifold compression. However, MMCR demands extensive input views, resulting in significant computational costs and protracted pre-training durations. Bridging this gap, we present an innovative integration of MMCR into existing SSL methods, incorporating a discerning regularization strategy that enhances the lower bound of mutual information. We also propose a novel state representation learning method extending DIM-UA, embedding a nuclear norm loss to enforce manifold consistency robustly. On experimentation with the Atari Annotated RAM Interface, our method improves DIM-UA significantly with the same number of target encoding dimensions. The mean F1 score averaged over categories is 78% compared to 75% of DIM-UA. There are also compelling gains when implementing SimCLR and Barlow Twins. This supports our SSL innovation as a paradigm shift, enabling more nuanced high-dimensional data representations.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning refers to the learning ability of a model during inference time without adapting its parameters. The input (i.e., prompt) to the model (e.g., transformers) consists of both a context (i.e., instance-label pairs) and a query instance. The model is then able to output a label for the query instance according to the context during inference. A possible explanation for in-context learning is that the forward pass of (linear) transformers implements iterations of gradient descent on the instance-label pairs in the context. In this paper, we prove by construction that transformers can also implement temporal difference (TD) learning in the forward pass, a phenomenon we refer to as in-context TD. We demonstrate the emergence of in-context TD after training the transformer with a multi-task TD algorithm, accompanied by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we prove that transformers are expressive enough to implement many other policy evaluation algorithms in the forward pass, including residual gradient, TD with eligibility trace, and average-reward TD.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Despite significant advancements in video generation and editing using diffusion models, achieving accurate and localized video editing remains a substantial challenge. Additionally, most existing video editing methods primarily focus on altering visual content, with limited research dedicated to motion editing. In this paper, we present a novel attempt to Remake a Video (ReVideo) which stands out from existing methods by allowing precise video editing in specific areas through the specification of both content and motion. Content editing is facilitated by modifying the first frame, while the trajectory-based motion control offers an intuitive user interaction experience. ReVideo addresses a new task involving the coupling and training imbalance between content and motion control. To tackle this, we develop a three-stage training strategy that progressively decouples these two aspects from coarse to fine. Furthermore, we propose a spatiotemporal adaptive fusion module to integrate content and motion control across various sampling steps and spatial locations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReVideo has promising performance on several accurate video editing applications, i.e., (1) locally changing video content while keeping the motion constant, (2) keeping content unchanged and customizing new motion trajectories, (3) modifying both content and motion trajectories. Our method can also seamlessly extend these applications to multi-area editing without specific training, demonstrating its flexibility and robustness.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Benefiting from large-scale pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative models, impressive progress has been achieved in customized image generation, which aims to generate user-specified concepts. Existing approaches have extensively focused on single-concept customization and still encounter challenges when it comes to complex scenarios that involve combining multiple concepts. These approaches often require retraining/fine-tuning using a few images, leading to time-consuming training processes and impeding their swift implementation. Furthermore, the reliance on multiple images to represent a singular concept increases the difficulty of customization. To this end, we propose FreeCustom, a novel tuning-free method to generate customized images of multi-concept composition based on reference concepts, using only one image per concept as input. Specifically, we introduce a new multi-reference self-attention (MRSA) mechanism and a weighted mask strategy that enables the generated image to access and focus more on the reference concepts. In addition, MRSA leverages our key finding that input concepts are better preserved when providing images with context interactions. Experiments show that our method's produced images are consistent with the given concepts and better aligned with the input text. Our method outperforms or performs on par with other training-based methods in terms of multi-concept composition and single-concept customization, but is simpler.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work studies the learning problem of the energy-based prior model and the multi-layer generator model. The multi-layer generator model, which contains multiple layers of latent variables organized in a top-down hierarchical structure, typically assumes the Gaussian prior model. Such a prior model can be limited in modelling expressivity, which results in a gap between the generator posterior and the prior model, known as the prior hole problem. Recent works have explored learning the energy-based (EBM) prior model as a second-stage, complementary model to bridge the gap. However, the EBM defined on a multi-layer latent space can be highly multi-modal, which makes sampling from such marginal EBM prior challenging in practice, resulting in ineffectively learned EBM. To tackle the challenge, we propose to leverage the diffusion probabilistic scheme to mitigate the burden of EBM sampling and thus facilitate EBM learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate a superior performance of our diffusion-learned EBM prior on various challenging tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Given the ubiquity of graph data, it is intriguing to ask: Is it possible to train a graph foundation model on a broad range of graph data across diverse domains? A major hurdle toward this goal lies in the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit profoundly divergent characteristics. Although there have been some initial efforts in integrating multi-domain graphs for pre-training, they primarily rely on textual descriptions to align the graphs, limiting their application to text-attributed graphs. Moreover, different source domains may conflict or interfere with each other, and their relevance to the target domain can vary significantly. To address these issues, we propose MDGPT, a text free Multi-Domain Graph Pre-Training and adaptation framework designed to exploit multi-domain knowledge for graph learning. First, we propose a set of domain tokens to to align features across source domains for synergistic pre-training. Second, we propose a dual prompts, consisting of a unifying prompt and a mixing prompt, to further adapt the target domain with unified multi-domain knowledge and a tailored mixture of domain-specific knowledge. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments involving six public datasets to evaluate and analyze MDGPT, which outperforms prior art by up to 37.9%.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to maximize a black-box objective function using only an offline dataset of designs and scores. A prevalent approach involves training a conditional generative model on existing designs and their associated scores, followed by the generation of new designs conditioned on higher target scores. However, these newly generated designs often underperform due to the lack of high-scoring training data. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method, Design Editing for Offline Model-based Optimization (DEMO), which consists of two phases. In the first phase, termed pseudo-target distribution generation, we apply gradient ascent on the offline dataset using a trained surrogate model, producing a synthetic dataset where the predicted scores serve as new labels. A conditional diffusion model is subsequently trained on this synthetic dataset to capture a pseudo-target distribution, which enhances the accuracy of the conditional diffusion model in generating higher-scoring designs. Nevertheless, the pseudo-target distribution is susceptible to noise stemming from inaccuracies in the surrogate model, consequently predisposing the conditional diffusion model to generate suboptimal designs. We hence propose the second phase, existing design editing, to directly incorporate the high-scoring features from the offline dataset into design generation. In this phase, top designs from the offline dataset are edited by introducing noise, which are subsequently refined using the conditional diffusion model to produce high-scoring designs. Overall, high-scoring designs begin with inheriting high-scoring features from the second phase and are further refined with a more accurate conditional diffusion model in the first phase. Empirical evaluations on 7 offline MBO tasks show that DEMO outperforms various baseline methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern power grids are undergoing significant changes driven by information and communication technologies (ICTs), and evolving into smart grids with higher efficiency and lower operation cost. Using ICTs, however, comes with an inevitable side effect that makes the power system more vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning-based framework to detect and identify various types of cyber attacks. Different from existing approaches, the proposed framework does not rely on large amounts of well-curated labeled data but makes use of the massive unlabeled data in the wild which are easily accessible. Specifically, the proposed framework adopts the BERT model from the natural language processing domain and learns generalizable and effective representations from the unlabeled sensing data, which capture the distinctive patterns of different attacks. Using the learned representations, together with a very small amount of labeled data, we can train a task-specific classifier to detect various types of cyber attacks. Meanwhile, real-world training datasets are usually imbalanced, i.e., there are only a limited number of data samples containing attacks. In order to cope with such data imbalance, we propose a new loss function, separate mean error (SME), which pays equal attention to the large and small categories to better train the model. Experiment results in a 5-area power grid system with 37 buses demonstrate the superior performance of our framework over existing approaches, especially when a very limited portion of labeled data are available, e.g., as low as 0.002\%. We believe such a framework can be easily adopted to detect a variety of cyber attacks in other power grid scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose autophagy penalized likelihood estimation (PLE), an unbiased alternative to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) which is more fair and less susceptible to model autophagy disorder (madness). Model autophagy refers to models trained on their own output; PLE ensures the statistics of these outputs coincide with the data statistics. This enables PLE to be statistically unbiased in certain scenarios where MLE is biased. When biased, MLE unfairly penalizes minority classes in unbalanced datasets and exacerbates the recently discovered issue of self-consuming generative modeling. Theoretical and empirical results show that 1) PLE is more fair to minority classes and 2) PLE is more stable in a self-consumed setting. Furthermore, we provide a scalable and portable implementation of PLE with a hypernetwork framework, allowing existing deep learning architectures to be easily trained with PLE. Finally, we show PLE can bridge the gap between Bayesian and frequentist paradigms in statistics.</li>

          Leveraging World Events to Predict E-Commerce Consumer Demand under Anomaly(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Consumer demand forecasting is of high importance for many e-commerce applications, including supply chain optimization, advertisement placement, and delivery speed optimization. However, reliable time series sales forecasting for e-commerce is difficult, especially during periods with many anomalies, as can often happen during pandemics, abnormal weather, or sports events. Although many time series algorithms have been applied to the task, prediction during anomalies still remains a challenge. In this work, we hypothesize that leveraging external knowledge found in world events can help overcome the challenge of prediction under anomalies. We mine a large repository of 40 years of world events and their textual representations. Further, we present a novel methodology based on transformers to construct an embedding of a day based on the relations of the day's events. Those embeddings are then used to forecast future consumer behavior. We empirically evaluate the methods over a large e-commerce products sales dataset, extracted from eBay, one of the world's largest online marketplaces. We show over numerous categories that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines during anomalies.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Solving inverse problems in scientific and engineering fields has long been intriguing and holds great potential for many applications, yet most techniques still struggle to address issues such as high dimensionality, nonlinearity and model uncertainty inherent in these problems. Recently, generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown great potential in approximating complex high dimensional conditional distributions and have paved the way for characterizing posterior densities in Bayesian inverse problems, yet the problems' high dimensionality and high nonlinearity often impedes the model's training. In this paper we show how to tackle these issues with Least Volume--a novel unsupervised nonlinear dimension reduction method--that can learn to represent the given datasets with the minimum number of latent variables while estimating their intrinsic dimensions. Once the low dimensional latent spaces are identified, efficient and accurate training of conditional generative models becomes feasible, resulting in a latent conditional GAN framework for posterior inference. We demonstrate the power of the proposed methodology on a variety of applications including inversion of parameters in systems of ODEs and high dimensional hydraulic conductivities in subsurface flow problems, and reveal the impact of the observables' and unobservables' intrinsic dimensions on inverse problems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track objects across frames in a video and segment them based on the initial annotated frame of the target objects. Previous VOS works typically rely on fully annotated videos for training. However, acquiring fully annotated training videos for VOS is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Meanwhile, self-supervised VOS methods have attempted to build VOS systems through correspondence learning and label propagation. Still, the absence of mask priors harms their robustness to complex scenarios, and the label propagation paradigm makes them impractical in terms of efficiency. To address these issues, we propose, for the first time, a general one-shot training framework for VOS, requiring only a single labeled frame per training video and applicable to a majority of state-of-the-art VOS networks. Specifically, our algorithm consists of: i) Inferring object masks time-forward based on the initial labeled frame. ii) Reconstructing the initial object mask time-backward using the masks from step i). Through this bi-directional training, a satisfactory VOS network can be obtained. Notably, our approach is extremely simple and can be employed end-to-end. Finally, our approach uses a single labeled frame of YouTube-VOS and DAVIS datasets to achieve comparable results to those trained on fully labeled datasets. The code will be released.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the success of 2D and 3D visual generative models, there is growing interest in generating 4D content. Existing methods primarily rely on text prompts to produce 4D content, but they often fall short of accurately defining complex or rare motions. To address this limitation, we propose MagicPose4D, a novel framework for refined control over both appearance and motion in 4D generation. Unlike traditional methods, MagicPose4D accepts monocular videos as motion prompts, enabling precise and customizable motion generation. MagicPose4D comprises two key modules: i) Dual-Phase 4D Reconstruction Module} which operates in two phases. The first phase focuses on capturing the model's shape using accurate 2D supervision and less accurate but geometrically informative 3D pseudo-supervision without imposing skeleton constraints. The second phase refines the model using more accurate pseudo-3D supervision, obtained in the first phase and introduces kinematic chain-based skeleton constraints to ensure physical plausibility. Additionally, we propose a Global-local Chamfer loss that aligns the overall distribution of predicted mesh vertices with the supervision while maintaining part-level alignment without extra annotations. ii) Cross-category Motion Transfer Module} leverages the predictions from the 4D reconstruction module and uses a kinematic-chain-based skeleton to achieve cross-category motion transfer. It ensures smooth transitions between frames through dynamic rigidity, facilitating robust generalization without additional training. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MagicPose4D significantly improves the accuracy and consistency of 4D content generation, outperforming existing methods in various benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective tabular data watermarking mechanism with statistical guarantees. We show theoretically that the proposed watermark can be effectively detected, while faithfully preserving the data fidelity, and also demonstrates appealing robustness against additive noise attack. The general idea is to achieve the watermarking through a strategic embedding based on simple data binning. Specifically, it divides the feature's value range into finely segmented intervals and embeds watermarks into selected ``green list" intervals. To detect the watermarks, we develop a principled statistical hypothesis-testing framework with minimal assumptions: it remains valid as long as the underlying data distribution has a continuous density function. The watermarking efficacy is demonstrated through rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical validation, highlighting its utility in enhancing the security of synthetic and real-world datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present a keypoint-based foundation model for general purpose brain MRI registration, based on the recently-proposed KeyMorph framework. Our model, called BrainMorph, serves as a tool that supports multi-modal, pairwise, and scalable groupwise registration. BrainMorph is trained on a massive dataset of over 100,000 3D volumes, skull-stripped and non-skull-stripped, from nearly 16,000 unique healthy and diseased subjects. BrainMorph is robust to large misalignments, interpretable via interrogating automatically-extracted keypoints, and enables rapid and controllable generation of many plausible transformations with different alignment types and different degrees of nonlinearity at test-time. We demonstrate the superiority of BrainMorph in solving 3D rigid, affine, and nonlinear registration on a variety of multi-modal brain MRI scans of healthy and diseased subjects, in both the pairwise and groupwise setting. In particular, we show registration accuracy and speeds that surpass current state-of-the-art methods, especially in the context of large initial misalignments and large group settings.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Latent diffusion has shown promising results in image generation and permits efficient sampling. However, this framework might suffer from the problem of posterior collapse when applied to time series. In this paper, we conduct an impact analysis of this problem. With a theoretical insight, we first explain that posterior collapse reduces latent diffusion to a VAE, making it less expressive. Then, we introduce the notion of dependency measures, showing that the latent variable sampled from the diffusion model loses control of the generation process in this situation and that latent diffusion exhibits dependency illusion in the case of shuffled time series. We also analyze the causes of posterior collapse and introduce a new framework based on this analysis, which addresses the problem and supports a more expressive prior distribution. Our experiments on various real-world time-series datasets demonstrate that our new model maintains a stable posterior and outperforms the baselines in time series generation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Real-world data deviating from the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption of in-distribution training data poses security threats to deep networks, thus advancing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection algorithms. Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The research of innovative methods aimed at reducing costs and shortening the time needed for simulation, going beyond conventional approaches based on Monte Carlo methods, has been sparked by the development of collision simulations at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Deep learning generative methods including VAE, GANs and diffusion models have been used for this purpose. Although they are much faster and simpler than standard approaches, they do not always keep high fidelity of the simulated data. This work aims to mitigate this issue, by providing an alternative solution to currently employed algorithms by introducing the mechanism of control over the generated data properties. To achieve this, we extend the recently introduced CorrVAE, which enables user-defined parameter manipulation of the generated output. We adapt the model to the problem of particle physics simulation. The proposed solution achieved promising results, demonstrating control over the parameters of the generated output and constituting an alternative for simulating the ZDC calorimeter in the ALICE experiment at CERN.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is a probability metric that has found numerous applications in machine learning. In this work, we focus on its application in generative models, including the minimum MMD estimator, Generative Moment Matching Network (GMMN), and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). In these cases, MMD is part of an objective function in a minimization or min-max optimization problem. Even if its empirical performance is competitive, the consistency and convergence rate analysis of the corresponding MMD-based estimators has yet to be carried out. We propose a uniform concentration inequality for a class of Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)-based estimators, that is, a maximum deviation bound of empirical MMD values over a collection of generated distributions and adversarially learned kernels. Here, our inequality serves as an efficient tool in the theoretical analysis for MMD-based generative models. As elaborating examples, we applied our main result to provide the generalization error bounds for the MMD-based estimators in the context of the minimum MMD estimator and MMD GAN.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models capable of producing high-quality images from pure noise. In particular, conditional diffusion models allow one to specify the contents of the desired image using a simple text prompt. Conditioning on a text prompt alone, however, does not allow for fine-grained control over the composition and layout of the final image, which instead depends closely on the initial noise distribution. While most methods which introduce spatial constraints (e.g., bounding boxes) require fine-tuning, a smaller and more recent subset of these methods are training-free. They are applicable whenever the prompt influences the model through an attention mechanism, and generally fall into one of two categories. The first entails modifying the cross-attention maps of specific tokens directly to enhance the signal in certain regions of the image. The second works by defining a loss function over the cross-attention maps, and using the gradient of this loss to guide the latent. While previous work explores these as alternative strategies, we provide an interpretation for these methods which highlights their complimentary features, and demonstrate that it is possible to obtain superior performance when both methods are used in concert.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dynamical systems are often time-varying, whose modeling requires a function that evolves with respect to time. Recent studies such as the neural ordinary differential equation proposed a time-dependent neural network, which provides a neural network varying with respect to time. However, we claim that the architectural choice to build a time-dependent neural network significantly affects its time-awareness but still lacks sufficient validation in its current states. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the architecture of modern time-dependent neural networks. Here, we report a vulnerability of vanishing timestep embedding, which disables the time-awareness of a time-dependent neural network. Furthermore, we find that this vulnerability can also be observed in diffusion models because they employ a similar architecture that incorporates timestep embedding to discriminate between different timesteps during a diffusion process. Our analysis provides a detailed description of this phenomenon as well as several solutions to address the root cause. Through experiments on neural ordinary differential equations and diffusion models, we observed that ensuring alive time-awareness via proposed solutions boosted their performance, which implies that their current implementations lack sufficient time-dependency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has made significant progress in understanding world knowledge and generating content from human languages across various modalities, like text-to-text large language models, text-to-image stable diffusion, and text-to-video Sora. While in this paper, we investigate the capability of GenAI for text-to-model generation, to see whether GenAI can comprehend hyper-level knowledge embedded within AI itself parameters. Specifically, we study a practical scenario termed train-once-for-all personalization, aiming to generate personalized models for diverse end-users and tasks using text prompts. Inspired by the recent emergence of neural network diffusion, we present Tina, a text-conditioned neural network diffusion for train-once-for-all personalization. Tina leverages a diffusion transformer model conditioned on task descriptions embedded using a CLIP model. Despite the astronomical number of potential personalized tasks (e.g., $1.73\times10^{13}$), by our design, Tina demonstrates remarkable in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization even trained on small datasets ($\sim 1000$). We further verify whether and how \Tina understands world knowledge by analyzing its capabilities under zero-shot/few-shot image prompts, different numbers of personalized classes, prompts of natural language descriptions, and predicting unseen entities.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Vision-Language Foundation model is increasingly investigated in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, yet its exploration in ophthalmology and broader medical applications remains limited. The challenge is the lack of labeled data for the training of foundation model. To handle this issue, a CLIP-style retinal image foundation model is developed in this paper. Our foundation model, RET-CLIP, is specifically trained on a dataset of 193,865 patients to extract general features of color fundus photographs (CFPs), employing a tripartite optimization strategy to focus on left eye, right eye, and patient level to reflect real-world clinical scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RET-CLIP outperforms existing benchmarks across eight diverse datasets spanning four critical diagnostic categories: diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, multiple disease diagnosis, and multi-label classification of multiple diseases, which demonstrate the performance and generality of our foundation model.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce a multimodal dataset where users express preferences through images. These images encompass a broad spectrum of visual expressions ranging from landscapes to artistic depictions. Users request recommendations for books or music that evoke similar feelings to those captured in the images, and recommendations are endorsed by the community through upvotes. This dataset supports two recommendation tasks: title generation and multiple-choice selection. Our experiments with large foundation models reveal their limitations in these tasks. Particularly, vision-language models show no significant advantage over language-only counterparts that use descriptions, which we hypothesize is due to underutilized visual capabilities. To better harness these abilities, we propose the chain-of-imagery prompting, which results in notable improvements. We release our code and datasets.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved rapid progress, exhibiting great perception and reasoning abilities concerning visual information. However, when faced with prompts in different sizes of solution spaces, LVLMs fail to always give consistent answers regarding the same knowledge point. This inconsistency of answers between different solution spaces is prevalent in LVLMs and erodes trust. To this end, we provide a multi-modal benchmark ConBench, to intuitively analyze how LVLMs perform when the solution space of a prompt revolves around a knowledge point. Based on the ConBench tool, we are the first to reveal the tapestry and get the following findings: (1) In the discriminate realm, the larger the solution space of the prompt, the lower the accuracy of the answers. (2) Establish the relationship between the discriminative and generative realms: the accuracy of the discriminative question type exhibits a strong positive correlation with its Consistency with the caption. (3) Compared to open-source models, closed-source models exhibit a pronounced bias advantage in terms of Consistency. Eventually, we ameliorate the consistency of LVLMs by trigger-based diagnostic refinement, indirectly improving the performance of their caption. We hope this paper will accelerate the research community in better evaluating their models and encourage future advancements in the consistency domain.</li>

          Self-Taught Recognizer: Toward Unsupervised Adaptation for Speech Foundation Models(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We propose an unsupervised adaptation framework, Self-TAught Recognizer (STAR), which leverages unlabeled data to enhance the robustness of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems in diverse target domains, such as noise and accents. STAR is developed for prevalent speech foundation models based on Transformer-related architecture with auto-regressive decoding (e.g., Whisper, Canary). Specifically, we propose a novel indicator that empirically integrates step-wise information during decoding to assess the token-level quality of pseudo labels without ground truth, thereby guiding model updates for effective unsupervised adaptation. Experimental results show that STAR achieves an average of 13.5% relative reduction in word error rate across 14 target domains, and it sometimes even approaches the upper-bound performance of supervised adaptation. Surprisingly, we also observe that STAR prevents the adapted model from the common catastrophic forgetting problem without recalling source-domain data. Furthermore, STAR exhibits high data efficiency that only requires less than one-hour unlabeled data, and seamless generality to alternative large speech models and speech translation tasks. Our code aims to open source to the research communities.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-view segmentation in Remote Sensing (RS) seeks to segment images from diverse perspectives within a scene. Recent methods leverage 3D information extracted from an Implicit Neural Field (INF), bolstering result consistency across multiple views while using limited accounts of labels (even within 3-5 labels) to streamline labor. Nonetheless, achieving superior performance within the constraints of limited-view labels remains challenging due to inadequate scene-wide supervision and insufficient semantic features within the INF. To address these. we propose to inject the prior of the visual foundation model-Segment Anything(SAM), to the INF to obtain better results under the limited number of training data. Specifically, we contrast SAM features between testing and training views to derive pseudo labels for each testing view, augmenting scene-wide labeling information. Subsequently, we introduce SAM features via a transformer into the INF of the scene, supplementing the semantic information. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the mainstream method, confirming the efficacy of SAM as a supplement to the INF for this task.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>RGB-D tracking significantly improves the accuracy of object tracking. However, its dependency on real depth inputs and the complexity involved in multi-modal fusion limit its applicability across various scenarios. The utilization of depth information in RGB-D tracking inspired us to propose a new method, named MDETrack, which trains a tracking network with an additional capability to understand the depth of scenes, through supervised or self-supervised auxiliary Monocular Depth Estimation learning. The outputs of MDETrack's unified feature extractor are fed to the side-by-side tracking head and auxiliary depth estimation head, respectively. The auxiliary module will be discarded in inference, thus keeping the same inference speed. We evaluated our models with various training strategies on multiple datasets, and the results show an improved tracking accuracy even without real depth. Through these findings we highlight the potential of depth estimation in enhancing object tracking performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Multi-modal object tracking (MMOT) is an emerging field that combines data from various modalities, \eg vision (RGB), depth, thermal infrared, event, language and audio, to estimate the state of an arbitrary object in a video sequence. It is of great significance for many applications such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance. In recent years, MMOT has received more and more attention. However, existing MMOT algorithms mainly focus on two modalities (\eg RGB+depth, RGB+thermal infrared, and RGB+language). To leverage more modalities, some recent efforts have been made to learn a unified visual object tracking model for any modality. Additionally, some large-scale multi-modal tracking benchmarks have been established by simultaneously providing more than two modalities, such as vision-language-audio (\eg WebUAV-3M) and vision-depth-language (\eg UniMod1K). To track the latest progress in MMOT, we conduct a comprehensive investigation in this report. Specifically, we first divide existing MMOT tasks into five main categories, \ie RGBL tracking, RGBE tracking, RGBD tracking, RGBT tracking, and miscellaneous (RGB+X), where X can be any modality, such as language, depth, and event. Then, we analyze and summarize each MMOT task, focusing on widely used datasets and mainstream tracking algorithms based on their technical paradigms (\eg self-supervised learning, prompt learning, knowledge distillation, generative models, and state space models). Finally, we maintain a continuously updated paper list for MMOT at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the advance of diffusion models, various personalized image generation methods have been proposed. However, almost all existing work only focuses on either subject-driven or style-driven personalization. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art methods face several challenges in realizing compositional personalization, i.e., composing different subject and style concepts, such as concept disentanglement, unified reconstruction paradigm, and insufficient training data. To address these issues, we introduce FreeTuner, a flexible and training-free method for compositional personalization that can generate any user-provided subject in any user-provided style (see Figure 1). Our approach employs a disentanglement strategy that separates the generation process into two stages to effectively mitigate concept entanglement. FreeTuner leverages the intermediate features within the diffusion model for subject concept representation and introduces style guidance to align the synthesized images with the style concept, ensuring the preservation of both the subject's structure and the style's aesthetic features. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the generation ability of FreeTuner across various personalization settings.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have achieved great success in image generation, with the backbone evolving from U-Net to Vision Transformers. However, the computational cost of Transformers is quadratic to the number of tokens, leading to significant challenges when dealing with high-resolution images. In this work, we propose Diffusion Mamba (DiM), which combines the efficiency of Mamba, a sequence model based on State Space Models (SSM), with the expressive power of diffusion models for efficient high-resolution image synthesis. To address the challenge that Mamba cannot generalize to 2D signals, we make several architecture designs including multi-directional scans, learnable padding tokens at the end of each row and column, and lightweight local feature enhancement. Our DiM architecture achieves inference-time efficiency for high-resolution images. In addition, to further improve training efficiency for high-resolution image generation with DiM, we investigate ``weak-to-strong'' training strategy that pretrains DiM on low-resolution images ($256\times 256$) and then finetune it on high-resolution images ($512 \times 512$). We further explore training-free upsampling strategies to enable the model to generate higher-resolution images (e.g., $1024\times 1024$ and $1536\times 1536$) without further fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our DiM.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Near-real time estimation of damage to buildings and infrastructure, referred to as damage nowcasting in this study, is crucial for empowering emergency responders to make informed decisions regarding evacuation orders and infrastructure repair priorities during disaster response and recovery. Here, we introduce FloodDamageCast, a machine learning framework tailored for property flood damage nowcasting. The framework leverages heterogeneous data to predict residential flood damage at a resolution of 500 meters by 500 meters within Harris County, Texas, during the 2017 Hurricane Harvey. To deal with data imbalance, FloodDamageCast incorporates a generative adversarial networks-based data augmentation coupled with an efficient machine learning model. The results demonstrate the model's ability to identify high-damage spatial areas that would be overlooked by baseline models. Insights gleaned from flood damage nowcasting can assist emergency responders to more efficiently identify repair needs, allocate resources, and streamline on-the-ground inspections, thereby saving both time and effort.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-language contrastive learning frameworks like CLIP enable learning representations from natural language supervision, and provide strong zero-shot classification capabilities. However, due to the nature of the supervisory signal in these paradigms, they lack the ability to learn localized features, leading to degraded performance on dense prediction tasks like segmentation and detection. On the other hand, self-supervised learning methods have shown the ability to learn granular representations, complementing the high-level features in vision-language training. In this work, we present Harmony, a framework that combines vision-language training with discriminative and generative self-supervision to learn visual features that can be generalized across vision downstream tasks. Our framework is specifically designed to work on web-scraped data by not relying on negative examples and addressing the one-to-one correspondence issue using soft CLIP targets generated by an EMA model. We comprehensively evaluate Harmony across various vision downstream tasks and find that it significantly outperforms the baseline CLIP and the previously leading joint self and weakly-supervised methods, MaskCLIP and SLIP. Specifically, when comparing against these methods, Harmony shows superior performance in fine-tuning and zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, semantic segmentation on ADE20K, and both object detection and instance segmentation on MS-COCO, when pre-training a ViT-S/16 on CC3M. We also show that Harmony outperforms other self-supervised learning methods like iBOT and MAE across all tasks evaluated. On this https URL our code is publicly available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion or score-based models recently showed high performance in image generation. They rely on a forward and a backward stochastic differential equations (SDE). The sampling of a data distribution is achieved by solving numerically the backward SDE or its associated flow ODE. Studying the convergence of these models necessitates to control four different types of error: the initialization error, the truncation error, the discretization and the score approximation. In this paper, we study theoretically the behavior of diffusion models and their numerical implementation when the data distribution is Gaussian. In this restricted framework where the score function is a linear operator, we can derive the analytical solutions of the forward and backward SDEs as well as the associated flow ODE. This provides exact expressions for various Wasserstein errors which enable us to compare the influence of each error type for any sampling scheme, thus allowing to monitor convergence directly in the data space instead of relying on Inception features. Our experiments show that the recommended numerical schemes from the diffusion models literature are also the best sampling schemes for Gaussian distributions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unlike natural language processing and computer vision, the development of Foundation Models (FMs) for time series forecasting is blocked due to data scarcity. While recent efforts are focused on building such FMs by unlocking the potential of language models (LMs) for time series analysis, dedicated parameters for various downstream forecasting tasks need training, which hinders the common knowledge sharing across domains. Moreover, data owners may hesitate to share the access to local data due to privacy concerns and copyright protection, which makes it impossible to simply construct a FM on cross-domain training instances. To address these issues, we propose Time-FFM, a Federated Foundation Model for Time series forecasting by leveraging pretrained LMs. Specifically, we begin by transforming time series into the modality of text tokens. To bootstrap LMs for time series reasoning, we propose a prompt adaption module to determine domain-customized prompts dynamically instead of artificially. Given the data heterogeneity across domains, we design a personalized federated training strategy by learning global encoders and local prediction heads. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Time-FFM outperforms state-of-the-arts and promises effective few-shot and zero-shot forecaster.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative, in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce ``Generative Fusion Decoding'' (GFD), a novel shallow fusion framework, utilized to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into multi-modal text recognition systems such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and optical character recognition (OCR). We derive the formulas necessary to enable GFD to operate across mismatched token spaces of different models by mapping text token space to byte token space, enabling seamless fusion during the decoding process. The framework is plug-and-play, compatible with various auto-regressive models, and does not require re-training for feature alignment, thus overcoming limitations of previous fusion techniques. We highlight three main advantages of GFD: First, by simplifying the complexity of aligning different model sample spaces, GFD allows LLMs to correct errors in tandem with the recognition model, reducing computation latencies. Second, the in-context learning ability of LLMs is fully capitalized by GFD, increasing robustness in long-form speech recognition and instruction aware speech recognition. Third, GFD enables fusing recognition models deficient in Chinese text recognition with LLMs extensively trained on Chinese. Our evaluation demonstrates that GFD significantly improves performance in ASR and OCR tasks, with ASR reaching state-of-the-art in the NTUML2021 benchmark. GFD provides a significant step forward in model integration, offering a unified solution that could be widely applicable to leveraging existing pre-trained models through step by step fusion.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Contrastive image-to-LiDAR knowledge transfer, commonly used for learning 3D representations with synchronized images and point clouds, often faces a self-conflict dilemma. This issue arises as contrastive losses unintentionally dissociate features of unmatched points and pixels that share semantic labels, compromising the integrity of learned representations. To overcome this, we harness Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which have revolutionized the acquisition of pixel-level semantics, to enhance 3D representation learning. Specifically, we utilize off-the-shelf VFMs to generate semantic labels for weakly-supervised pixel-to-point contrastive distillation. Additionally, we employ von Mises-Fisher distributions to structure the feature space, ensuring semantic embeddings within the same class remain consistent across varying inputs. Furthermore, we adapt sampling probabilities of points to address imbalances in spatial distribution and category frequency, promoting comprehensive and balanced learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach mitigates the challenges posed by traditional methods and consistently surpasses existing image-to-LiDAR contrastive distillation methods in downstream tasks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Hypergraphs are widely employed to represent complex higher-order relationships in real-world applications. Most hypergraph learning research focuses on node- or edge-level tasks. A practically relevant but more challenging task, edge-dependent node classification (ENC), is only recently proposed. In ENC, a node can have different labels across different hyperedges, which requires the modeling of node-hyperedge pairs instead of single nodes or hyperedges. Existing solutions for this task are based on message passing and model within-edge and within-node interactions as multi-input single-output functions. This brings three limitations: (1) non-adaptive representation size, (2) node/edge agnostic messages, and (3) insufficient interactions among nodes or hyperedges. To tackle these limitations, we develop CoNHD, a new solution based on hypergraph diffusion. Specifically, we first extend hypergraph diffusion using node-hyperedge co-representations. This extension explicitly models both within-edge and within-node interactions as multi-input multi-output functions using two equivariant diffusion operators. To avoid handcrafted regularization functions, we propose a neural implementation for the co-representation hypergraph diffusion process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CoNHD model.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Gloss-free sign language translation (SLT) aims to develop well-performing SLT systems with no requirement for the costly gloss annotations, but currently still lags behind gloss-based approaches significantly. In this paper, we identify a representation density problem that could be a bottleneck in restricting the performance of gloss-free SLT. Specifically, the representation density problem describes that the visual representations of semantically distinct sign gestures tend to be closely packed together in feature space, which makes gloss-free methods struggle with distinguishing different sign gestures and suffer from a sharp performance drop. To address the representation density problem, we introduce a simple but effective contrastive learning strategy, namely SignCL, which encourages gloss-free models to learn more discriminative feature representation in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed SignCL can significantly reduce the representation density and improve performance across various translation frameworks. Specifically, SignCL achieves a significant improvement in BLEU score for the Sign Language Transformer and GFSLT-VLP on the CSL-Daily dataset by 39% and 46%, respectively, without any increase of model parameters. Compared to Sign2GPT, a state-of-the-art method based on large-scale pre-trained vision and language models, SignCL achieves better performance with only 35% of its parameters.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies highlighted a practical setting of unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) that builds a unified model for multi-class images, serving as an alternative to the conventional one-class-one-model setup. Despite various advancements addressing this challenging task, the detection performance under the multi-class setting still lags far behind state-of-the-art class-separated models. Our research aims to bridge this substantial performance gap. In this paper, we introduce a minimalistic reconstruction-based anomaly detection framework, namely Dinomaly, which leverages pure Transformer architectures without relying on complex designs, additional modules, or specialized tricks. Given this powerful framework consisted of only Attentions and MLPs, we found four simple components that are essential to multi-class anomaly detection: (1) Foundation Transformers that extracts universal and discriminative features, (2) Noisy Bottleneck where pre-existing Dropouts do all the noise injection tricks, (3) Linear Attention that naturally cannot focus, and (4) Loose Reconstruction that does not force layer-to-layer and point-by-point reconstruction. Extensive experiments are conducted across three popular anomaly detection benchmarks including MVTec-AD, VisA, and the recently released Real-IAD. Our proposed Dinomaly achieves impressive image AUROC of 99.6%, 98.7%, and 89.3% on the three datasets respectively, which is not only superior to state-of-the-art multi-class UAD methods, but also surpasses the most advanced class-separated UAD records.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work introduces the conditioned Vehicle Motion Diffusion (cVMD) model, a novel network architecture for highway trajectory prediction using diffusion models. The proposed model ensures the drivability of the predicted trajectory by integrating non-holonomic motion constraints and physical constraints into the generative prediction module. Central to the architecture of cVMD is its capacity to perform uncertainty quantification, a feature that is crucial in safety-critical applications. By integrating the quantified uncertainty into the prediction process, the cVMD's trajectory prediction performance is improved considerably. The model's performance was evaluated using the publicly available highD dataset. Experiments show that the proposed architecture achieves competitive trajectory prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models, while providing guaranteed drivable trajectories and uncertainty quantification.</li>

          Emotion Identification for French in Written Texts: Considering their Modes of Expression as a Step Towards Text Complexity Analysis(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The objective of this paper is to predict (A) whether a sentence in a written text expresses an emotion, (B) the mode(s) in which it is expressed, (C) whether it is basic or complex, and (D) its emotional category. One of our major contributions, through a dataset and a model, is to integrate the fact that an emotion can be expressed in different modes: from a direct mode, essentially lexicalized, to a more indirect mode, where emotions will only be suggested, a mode that NLP approaches generally don't take into account. Another originality is that the scope is on written texts, as opposed usual work focusing on conversational (often multi-modal) data. In this context, modes of expression are seen as a factor towards the automatic analysis of complexity in texts. Experiments on French texts show acceptable results compared to the human annotators' agreement, and outperforming results compared to using a large language model with in-context learning (i.e. no fine-tuning).</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Learning invariant representations has been the longstanding approach to self-supervised learning. However, recently progress has been made in preserving equivariant properties in representations, yet do so with highly prescribed architectures. In this work, we propose an invariant-equivariant self-supervised architecture that employs Capsule Networks (CapsNets) which have been shown to capture equivariance with respect to novel viewpoints. We demonstrate that the use of CapsNets in equivariant self-supervised architectures achieves improved downstream performance on equivariant tasks with higher efficiency and fewer network parameters. To accommodate the architectural changes of CapsNets, we introduce a new objective function based on entropy minimisation. This approach, which we name CapsIE (Capsule Invariant Equivariant Network), achieves state-of-the-art performance across all invariant and equivariant downstream tasks on the 3DIEBench dataset, while outperforming supervised baselines. Our results demonstrate the ability of CapsNets to learn complex and generalised representations for large-scale, multi-task datasets compared to previous CapsNet benchmarks.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper introduces PipeFusion, a novel approach that harnesses multi-GPU parallelism to address the high computational and latency challenges of generating high-resolution images with diffusion transformers (DiT) models. PipeFusion splits images into patches and distributes the network layers across multiple devices. It employs a pipeline parallel manner to orchestrate communication and computations. By leveraging the high similarity between the input from adjacent diffusion steps, PipeFusion eliminates the waiting time in the pipeline by reusing the one-step stale feature maps to provide context for the current step. Our experiments demonstrate that it can generate higher image resolution where existing DiT parallel approaches meet OOM. PipeFusion significantly reduces the required communication bandwidth, enabling DiT inference to be hosted on GPUs connected via PCIe rather than the more costly NVLink infrastructure, which substantially lowers the overall operational expenses for serving DiT models.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Schrödinger Bridge (SB) problem offers a powerful framework for combining optimal transport and diffusion models. A promising recent approach to solve the SB problem is the Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure, which alternates between Markovian and reciprocal projections of continuous-time stochastic processes. However, the model built by the IMF procedure has a long inference time due to using many steps of numerical solvers for stochastic differential equations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Discrete-time IMF (D-IMF) procedure in which learning of stochastic processes is replaced by learning just a few transition probabilities in discrete time. Its great advantage is that in practice it can be naturally implemented using the Denoising Diffusion GAN (DD-GAN), an already well-established adversarial generative modeling technique. We show that our D-IMF procedure can provide the same quality of unpaired domain translation as the IMF, using only several generation steps instead of hundreds.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Editing objects within a scene is a critical functionality required across a broad spectrum of applications in computer vision and graphics. As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerges as a frontier in scene representation, the effective modification of 3D Gaussian scenes has become increasingly vital. This process entails accurately retrieve the target objects and subsequently performing modifications based on instructions. Though available in pieces, existing techniques mainly embed sparse semantics into Gaussians for retrieval, and rely on an iterative dataset update paradigm for editing, leading to over-smoothing or inconsistency issues. To this end, this paper proposes a systematic approach, namely TIGER, for coherent text-instructed 3D Gaussian retrieval and editing. In contrast to the top-down language grounding approach for 3D Gaussians, we adopt a bottom-up language aggregation strategy to generate a denser language embedded 3D Gaussians that supports open-vocabulary retrieval. To overcome the over-smoothing and inconsistency issues in editing, we propose a Coherent Score Distillation (CSD) that aggregates a 2D image editing diffusion model and a multi-view diffusion model for score distillation, producing multi-view consistent editing with much finer details. In various experiments, we demonstrate that our TIGER is able to accomplish more consistent and realistic edits than prior work.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While controllable generative models for images and videos have achieved remarkable success, high-quality models for 3D scenes, particularly in unbounded scenarios like autonomous driving, remain underdeveloped due to high data acquisition costs. In this paper, we introduce MagicDrive3D, a novel pipeline for controllable 3D street scene generation that supports multi-condition control, including BEV maps, 3D objects, and text descriptions. Unlike previous methods that reconstruct before training the generative models, MagicDrive3D first trains a video generation model and then reconstructs from the generated data. This innovative approach enables easily controllable generation and static scene acquisition, resulting in high-quality scene reconstruction. To address the minor errors in generated content, we propose deformable Gaussian splatting with monocular depth initialization and appearance modeling to manage exposure discrepancies across viewpoints. Validated on the nuScenes dataset, MagicDrive3D generates diverse, high-quality 3D driving scenes that support any-view rendering and enhance downstream tasks like BEV segmentation. Our results demonstrate the framework's superior performance, showcasing its transformative potential for autonomous driving simulation and beyond.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs) have revolutionized high-resolution image generation, but the design space of the autoencoder that is central to these systems remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LiteVAE, a family of autoencoders for LDMs that leverage the 2D discrete wavelet transform to enhance scalability and computational efficiency over standard variational autoencoders (VAEs) with no sacrifice in output quality. We also investigate the training methodologies and the decoder architecture of LiteVAE and propose several enhancements that improve the training dynamics and reconstruction quality. Our base LiteVAE model matches the quality of the established VAEs in current LDMs with a six-fold reduction in encoder parameters, leading to faster training and lower GPU memory requirements, while our larger model outperforms VAEs of comparable complexity across all evaluated metrics (rFID, LPIPS, PSNR, and SSIM).</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The recent progression of Large Language Models (LLMs) has witnessed great success in the fields of data-centric applications. LLMs trained on massive textual datasets showed ability to encode not only context but also ability to provide powerful comprehension to downstream tasks. Interestingly, Generative Pre-trained Transformers utilised this ability to bring AI a step closer to human being replacement in at least datacentric applications. Such power can be leveraged to identify anomalies of cyber threats, enhance incident response, and automate routine security operations. We provide an overview for the recent activities of LLMs in cyber defence sections, as well as categorization for the cyber defence sections such as threat intelligence, vulnerability assessment, network security, privacy preserving, awareness and training, automation, and ethical guidelines. Fundamental concepts of the progression of LLMs from Transformers, Pre-trained Transformers, and GPT is presented. Next, the recent works of each section is surveyed with the related strengths and weaknesses. A special section about the challenges and directions of LLMs in cyber security is provided. Finally, possible future research directions for benefiting from LLMs in cyber security is discussed.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The widespread usage of large-scale multimodal models like CLIP has heightened concerns about the leakage of personally identifiable information (PII). Existing methods for identity inference in CLIP models, i.e., to detect the presence of a person's PII used for training a CLIP model, require querying the model with full PII, including textual descriptions of the person and corresponding images (e.g., the name and the face photo of the person). However, this may lead to potential privacy breach of the image, as it may have not been seen by the target model yet. Additionally, traditional membership inference attacks (MIAs) train shadow models to mimic the behaviors of the target model, which incurs high computational costs, especially for large CLIP models. To address these challenges, we propose a textual unimodal detector (TUNI) in CLIP models, a novel method for ID inference that 1) queries the target model with only text data; and 2) does not require training shadow models. Firstly, we develop a feature extraction algorithm, guided by the CLIP model, to extract features from a text description. TUNI starts with randomly generating textual gibberish that were clearly not utilized for training, and leverages their feature vectors to train a system of anomaly detectors. During inference, the feature vector of each test text is fed into the anomaly detectors to determine if the person's PII is in the training set (abnormal) or not (normal). Moreover, TUNI can be further strengthened integrating real images associated with the tested individuals, if available at the detector. Extensive experiments of TUNI across various CLIP model architectures and datasets demonstrate its superior performance over baselines, albeit with only text data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in multimodal foundation models have set new standards in few-shot anomaly detection. This paper explores whether high-quality visual features alone are sufficient to rival existing state-of-the-art vision-language models. We affirm this by adapting DINOv2 for one-shot and few-shot anomaly detection, with a focus on industrial applications. We show that this approach does not only rival existing techniques but can even outmatch them in many settings. Our proposed vision-only approach, AnomalyDINO, is based on patch similarities and enables both image-level anomaly prediction and pixel-level anomaly segmentation. The approach is methodologically simple and training-free and, thus, does not require any additional data for fine-tuning or meta-learning. Despite its simplicity, AnomalyDINO achieves state-of-the-art results in one- and few-shot anomaly detection (e.g., pushing the one-shot performance on MVTec-AD from an AUROC of 93.1% to 96.6%). The reduced overhead, coupled with its outstanding few-shot performance, makes AnomalyDINO a strong candidate for fast deployment, for example, in industrial contexts.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Models for monocular shape reconstruction of surfaces with diffuse reflection -- shape from shading -- ought to produce distributions of outputs, because there are fundamental mathematical ambiguities of both continuous (e.g., bas-relief) and discrete (e.g., convex/concave) varieties which are also experienced by humans. Yet, the outputs of current models are limited to point estimates or tight distributions around single modes, which prevent them from capturing these effects. We introduce a model that reconstructs a multimodal distribution of shapes from a single shading image, which aligns with the human experience of multistable perception. We train a small denoising diffusion process to generate surface normal fields from $16\times 16$ patches of synthetic images of everyday 3D objects. We deploy this model patch-wise at multiple scales, with guidance from inter-patch shape consistency constraints. Despite its relatively small parameter count and predominantly bottom-up structure, we show that multistable shape explanations emerge from this model for ''ambiguous'' test images that humans experience as being multistable. At the same time, the model produces veridical shape estimates for object-like images that include distinctive occluding contours and appear less ambiguous. This may inspire new architectures for stochastic 3D shape perception that are more efficient and better aligned with human experience.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transformers have significantly advanced the modeling of Electronic Health Records (EHR), yet their deployment in real-world healthcare is limited by several key challenges. Firstly, the quadratic computational cost and insufficient context length of these models pose significant obstacles for hospitals in processing the extensive medical histories typical in EHR data. Additionally, existing models employ separate finetuning for each clinical task, complicating maintenance in healthcare environments. Moreover, these models focus exclusively on either clinical prediction or EHR forecasting, lacking the flexibility to perform well across both. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EHRMamba, a robust foundation model built on the Mamba architecture. EHRMamba can process sequences up to four times longer than previous models due to its linear computational cost. We also introduce a novel approach to Multitask Prompted Finetuning (MTF) for EHR data, which enables EHRMamba to simultaneously learn multiple clinical tasks in a single finetuning phase, significantly enhancing deployment and cross-task generalization. Furthermore, our model leverages the HL7 FHIR data standard to simplify integration into existing hospital systems. Alongside EHRMamba, we open-source Odyssey, a toolkit designed to support the development and deployment of EHR foundation models, with an emphasis on data standardization and interpretability. Our evaluations on the MIMIC-IV dataset demonstrate that EHRMamba advances state-of-the-art performance across 6 major clinical tasks and excels in EHR forecasting, marking a significant leap forward in the field.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we introduce PoseCrafter, a one-shot method for personalized video generation following the control of flexible poses. Built upon Stable Diffusion and ControlNet, we carefully design an inference process to produce high-quality videos without the corresponding ground-truth frames. First, we select an appropriate reference frame from the training video and invert it to initialize all latent variables for generation. Then, we insert the corresponding training pose into the target pose sequences to enhance faithfulness through a trained temporal attention module. Furthermore, to alleviate the face and hand degradation resulting from discrepancies between poses of training videos and inference poses, we implement simple latent editing through an affine transformation matrix involving facial and hand landmarks. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that PoseCrafter achieves superior results to baselines pre-trained on a vast collection of videos under 8 commonly used metrics. Besides, PoseCrafter can follow poses from different individuals or artificial edits and simultaneously retain the human identity in an open-domain training video.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In recent years, with the realistic generation results and a wide range of personalized applications, diffusion-based generative models gain huge attention in both visual and audio generation areas. Compared to the considerable advancements of text2image or text2audio generation, research in audio2visual or visual2audio generation has been relatively slow. The recent audio-visual generation methods usually resort to huge large language model or composable diffusion models. Instead of designing another giant model for audio-visual generation, in this paper we take a step back showing a simple and lightweight generative transformer, which is not fully investigated in multi-modal generation, can achieve excellent results on image2audio generation. The transformer operates in the discrete audio and visual Vector-Quantized GAN space, and is trained in the mask denoising manner. After training, the classifier-free guidance could be deployed off-the-shelf achieving better performance, without any extra training or modification. Since the transformer model is modality symmetrical, it could also be directly deployed for audio2image generation and co-generation. In the experiments, we show that our simple method surpasses recent image2audio generation methods. Generated audio samples can be found at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Deep learning has revolutionized the field of computer vision by introducing large scale neural networks with millions of parameters. Training these networks requires massive datasets and leads to intransparent models that can fail to generalize. At the other extreme, models designed from partial differential equations (PDEs) embed specialized domain knowledge into mathematical equations and usually rely on few manually chosen hyperparameters. This makes them transparent by construction and if designed and calibrated carefully, they can generalize well to unseen scenarios. In this paper, we show how to bring model- and data-driven approaches together by combining the explicit PDE-based approaches with convolutional neural networks to obtain the best of both worlds. We illustrate a joint architecture for the task of inpainting optical flow fields and show that the combination of model- and data-driven modeling leads to an effective architecture. Our model outperforms both fully explicit and fully data-driven baselines in terms of reconstruction quality, robustness and amount of required training data. Averaging the endpoint error across different mask densities, our method outperforms the explicit baselines by 11-27%, the GAN baseline by 47% and the Probabilisitic Diffusion baseline by 42%. With that, our method sets a new state of the art for inpainting of optical flow fields from random masks.</li>

          Reinforcement Learning for Fine-tuning Text-to-speech Diffusion Models(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in generative models have sparked significant interest within the machine learning community. Particularly, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in synthesizing images and speech. Studies such as those by Lee et al. [19], Black et al. [4], Wang et al. [36], and Fan et al. [8] illustrate that Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can enhance diffusion models for image synthesis. However, due to architectural differences between these models and those employed in speech synthesis, it remains uncertain whether RLHF could similarly benefit speech synthesis models. In this paper, we explore the practical application of RLHF to diffusion-based text-to-speech synthesis, leveraging the mean opinion score (MOS) as predicted by UTokyo-SaruLab MOS prediction system [29] as a proxy loss. We introduce diffusion model loss-guided RL policy optimization (DLPO) and compare it against other RLHF approaches, employing the NISQA speech quality and naturalness assessment model [21] and human preference experiments for further evaluation. Our results show that RLHF can enhance diffusion-based text-to-speech synthesis models, and, moreover, DLPO can better improve diffusion models in generating natural and high quality speech audios.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>There is a growing attention given to utilizing Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics with network training in order to incorporate physics into the network. Most commonly, conservative systems are modeled, in which there are no frictional losses, so the system may be run forward and backward in time without requiring regularization. This work addresses systems in which the reverse direction is ill-posed because of the dissipation that occurs in forward evolution. The novelty is the use of Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian, which models dissipative dynamics by doubling the number of dimensions of the system in order to create a mirror latent representation that would counterbalance the dissipation of the observable system, making it a conservative system, albeit embedded in a larger space. We start with their formal approach by redefining a new Dissipative Lagrangian, such that the unknown matrices in the Euler-Lagrange's equations arise as partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to only the observables. We then train a network from simulated training data for dissipative systems such as Fickian diffusion that arise in materials sciences. It is shown by experiments that the systems can be evolved in both forward and reverse directions without regularization beyond that provided by the Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian. Experiments of dissipative systems, such as Fickian diffusion, demonstrate the degree to which dynamics can be reversed.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>SimSiam is a prominent self-supervised learning method that achieves impressive results in various vision tasks under static environments. However, it has two critical issues: high sensitivity to hyperparameters, especially weight decay, and unsatisfactory performance in online and continual learning, where neuroscientists believe that powerful memory functions are necessary, as in brains. In this paper, we propose PhiNet, inspired by a hippocampal model based on the temporal prediction hypothesis. Unlike SimSiam, which aligns two augmented views of the original image, PhiNet integrates an additional predictor block that estimates the original image representation to imitate the CA1 region in the hippocampus. Moreover, we model the neocortex inspired by the Complementary Learning Systems theory with a momentum encoder block as a slow learner, which works as long-term memory. We demonstrate through analysing the learning dynamics that PhiNet benefits from the additional predictor to prevent the complete collapse of learned representations, a notorious challenge in non-contrastive learning. This dynamics analysis may partially corroborate why this hippocampal model is biologically plausible. Experimental results demonstrate that PhiNet is more robust to weight decay and performs better than SimSiam in memory-intensive tasks like online and continual learning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context Learning (ICL) empowers large language models (LLMs) to adapt to unseen tasks during inference by prefixing a few demonstration examples prior to test queries. Despite its versatility, ICL incurs substantial computational and memory overheads compared to zero-shot learning and is susceptible to the selection and order of demonstration examples. In this work, we introduce Implicit In-context Learning (I2CL), an innovative paradigm that addresses the challenges associated with traditional ICL by absorbing demonstration examples within the activation space. I2CL first generates a condensed vector representation, namely a context vector, from the demonstration examples. It then integrates the context vector during inference by injecting a linear combination of the context vector and query activations into the model's residual streams. Empirical evaluation on nine real-world tasks across three model architectures demonstrates that I2CL achieves few-shot performance with zero-shot cost and exhibits robustness against the variation of demonstration examples. Furthermore, I2CL facilitates a novel representation of "task-ids", enhancing task similarity detection and enabling effective transfer learning. We provide a comprehensive analysis of I2CL, offering deeper insights into its mechanisms and broader implications for ICL. The source code is available at: this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generative modeling over discrete data has recently seen numerous success stories, with applications spanning language modeling, biological sequence design, and graph-structured molecular data. The predominant generative modeling paradigm for discrete data is still autoregressive, with more recent alternatives based on diffusion or flow-matching falling short of their impressive performance in continuous data settings, such as image or video generation. In this work, we introduce Fisher-Flow, a novel flow-matching model for discrete data. Fisher-Flow takes a manifestly geometric perspective by considering categorical distributions over discrete data as points residing on a statistical manifold equipped with its natural Riemannian metric: the $\textit{Fisher-Rao metric}$. As a result, we demonstrate discrete data itself can be continuously reparameterised to points on the positive orthant of the $d$-hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^d_+$, which allows us to define flows that map any source distribution to target in a principled manner by transporting mass along (closed-form) geodesics of $\mathbb{S}^d_+$. Furthermore, the learned flows in Fisher-Flow can be further bootstrapped by leveraging Riemannian optimal transport leading to improved training dynamics. We prove that the gradient flow induced by Fisher-Flow is optimal in reducing the forward KL divergence. We evaluate Fisher-Flow on an array of synthetic and diverse real-world benchmarks, including designing DNA Promoter, and DNA Enhancer sequences. Empirically, we find that Fisher-Flow improves over prior diffusion and flow-matching models on these benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Data, the seminal opportunity and challenge in modern machine learning, currently constrains the scalability of representation learning and impedes the pace of model evolution. Existing paradigms tackle the issue of learning efficiency over massive datasets from the perspective of self-supervised learning and dataset distillation independently, while neglecting the untapped potential of accelerating representation learning from an intermediate standpoint. In this work, we delve into defining the ideal data properties from both optimization and generalization perspectives. We propose that model-generated representations, despite being trained on diverse tasks and architectures, converge to a shared linear space, facilitating effective linear transport between models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these representations exhibit properties conducive to the formation of ideal data. The theoretical/empirical insights therein inspire us to propose a Representation Learning Accelerator (ReLA), which leverages a task- and architecture-agnostic, yet publicly available, free model to form a dynamic data subset and thus accelerate (self-)supervised learning. For instance, employing a CLIP ViT B/16 as a prior model for dynamic data generation, ReLA-aided BYOL can train a ResNet-50 from scratch with 50% of ImageNet-1K, yielding performance surpassing that of training on the full dataset. Additionally, employing a ResNet-18 pre-trained on CIFAR-10 can enhance ResNet-50 training on 10% of ImageNet-1K, resulting in a 7.7% increase in accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Self-supervised learning models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks that are effective in self-supervised learning often involve noticeable triggers, like colored patches, which are vulnerable to human inspection. In this paper, we propose an imperceptible and effective backdoor attack against self-supervised models. We first find that existing imperceptible triggers designed for supervised learning are not as effective in compromising self-supervised models. We then identify this ineffectiveness is attributed to the overlap in distributions between the backdoor and augmented samples used in self-supervised learning. Building on this insight, we design an attack using optimized triggers that are disentangled to the augmented transformation in the self-supervised learning, while also remaining imperceptible to human vision. Experiments on five datasets and seven SSL algorithms demonstrate our attack is highly effective and stealthy. It also has strong resistance to existing backdoor defenses.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Customizing diffusion models to generate identity-preserving images from user-provided reference images is an intriguing new problem. The prevalent approaches typically require training on extensive domain-specific images to achieve identity preservation, which lacks flexibility across different use cases. To address this issue, we exploit classifier guidance, a training-free technique that steers diffusion models using an existing classifier, for personalized image generation. Our study shows that based on a recent rectified flow framework, the major limitation of vanilla classifier guidance in requiring a special classifier can be resolved with a simple fixed-point solution, allowing flexible personalization with off-the-shelf image discriminators. Moreover, its solving procedure proves to be stable when anchored to a reference flow trajectory, with a convergence guarantee. The derived method is implemented on rectified flow with different off-the-shelf image discriminators, delivering advantageous personalization results for human faces, live subjects, and certain objects.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we investigate the feature encoding process in a prototypical energy-based generative model, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). We start with an analytical investigation using simplified architectures and data structures, and end with numerical analysis of real trainings on real datasets. Our study tracks the evolution of the model's weight matrix through its singular value decomposition, revealing a series of phase transitions associated to a progressive learning of the principal modes of the empirical probability distribution. The model first learns the center of mass of the modes and then progressively resolve all modes through a cascade of phase transitions. We first describe this process analytically in a controlled setup that allows us to study analytically the training dynamics. We then validate our theoretical results by training the Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM on real data sets. By using data sets of increasing dimension, we show that learning indeed leads to sharp phase transitions in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we propose and test a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis. This shows that the first phase transition is in the same universality class of the one we studied analytically, and which is reminiscent of the mean-field paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern AI models provide the key to a long-standing dream: processing analytical queries about almost any kind of data. Until recently, it was difficult and expensive to extract facts from company documents, data from scientific papers, or insights from image and video corpora. Today's models can accomplish these tasks with high accuracy. However, a programmer who wants to answer a substantive AI-powered query must orchestrate large numbers of models, prompts, and data operations. For even a single query, the programmer has to make a vast number of decisions such as the choice of model, the right inference method, the most cost-effective inference hardware, the ideal prompt design, and so on. The optimal set of decisions can change as the query changes and as the rapidly-evolving technical landscape shifts. In this paper we present Palimpzest, a system that enables anyone to process AI-powered analytical queries simply by defining them in a declarative language. The system uses its cost optimization framework -- which explores the search space of AI models, prompting techniques, and related foundation model optimizations -- to implement the query with the best trade-offs between runtime, financial cost, and output data quality. We describe the workload of AI-powered analytics tasks, the optimization methods that Palimpzest uses, and the prototype system itself. We evaluate Palimpzest on tasks in Legal Discovery, Real Estate Search, and Medical Schema Matching. We show that even our simple prototype offers a range of appealing plans, including one that is 3.3x faster, 2.9x cheaper, and offers better data quality than the baseline method. With parallelism enabled, Palimpzest can produce plans with up to a 90.3x speedup at 9.1x lower cost relative to a single-threaded GPT-4 baseline, while obtaining an F1-score within 83.5% of the baseline. These require no additional work by the user.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Scene text synthesis involves rendering specified texts onto arbitrary images. Current methods typically formulate this task in an end-to-end manner but lack effective character-level guidance during training. Besides, their text encoders, pre-trained on a single font type, struggle to adapt to the diverse font styles encountered in practical applications. Consequently, these methods suffer from character distortion, repetition, and absence, particularly in polystylistic scenarios. To this end, this paper proposes DreamText for high-fidelity scene text synthesis. Our key idea is to reconstruct the diffusion training process, introducing more refined guidance tailored to this task, to expose and rectify the model's attention at the character level and strengthen its learning of text regions. This transformation poses a hybrid optimization challenge, involving both discrete and continuous variables. To effectively tackle this challenge, we employ a heuristic alternate optimization strategy. Meanwhile, we jointly train the text encoder and generator to comprehensively learn and utilize the diverse font present in the training dataset. This joint training is seamlessly integrated into the alternate optimization process, fostering a synergistic relationship between learning character embedding and re-estimating character attention. Specifically, in each step, we first encode potential character-generated position information from cross-attention maps into latent character masks. These masks are then utilized to update the representation of specific characters in the current step, which, in turn, enables the generator to correct the character's attention in the subsequent steps. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for safe real-world deployment of machine learning models. Recent advances in vision language foundation models have made them capable of detecting OOD samples without requiring in-distribution (ID) images. However, these zero-shot methods often underperform as they do not adequately consider ID class likelihoods in their detection confidence scoring. Hence, we introduce CLIPScope, a zero-shot OOD detection approach that normalizes the confidence score of a sample by class likelihoods, akin to a Bayesian posterior update. Furthermore, CLIPScope incorporates a novel strategy to mine OOD classes from a large lexical database. It selects class labels that are farthest and nearest to ID classes in terms of CLIP embedding distance to maximize coverage of OOD samples. We conduct extensive ablation studies and empirical evaluations, demonstrating state of the art performance of CLIPScope across various OOD detection benchmarks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adapting pre-trained foundation models for various downstream tasks has been prevalent in artificial intelligence. Due to the vast number of tasks and high costs, adjusting all parameters becomes unfeasible. To mitigate this, several fine-tuning techniques have been developed to update the pre-trained model weights in a more resource-efficient manner, such as through low-rank adjustments. Yet, almost all of these methods focus on linear weights, neglecting the intricacies of parameter spaces in higher dimensions like 4D. Alternatively, some methods can be adapted for high-dimensional parameter space by compressing changes in the original space into two dimensions and then employing low-rank matrix decomposition. However, these approaches destructs the structural integrity of the involved high-dimensional spaces. To tackle the diversity of dimensional spaces across different foundation models and provide a more precise representation of the changes within these spaces, this paper introduces a generalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework, FLoRA, designed for various dimensional parameter space. Specifically, utilizing Tucker decomposition, FLoRA asserts that changes in each dimensional parameter space are based on a low-rank core space which maintains the consistent topological structure with the original space. It then models the changes through this core space alongside corresponding weights to reconstruct alterations in the original space. FLoRA effectively preserves the structural integrity of the change of original N-dimensional parameter space, meanwhile decomposes it via low-rank tensor decomposition. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural language processing and multi-modal tasks validate FLoRA's effectiveness. Codes are available at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent studies have shown the ability of large language models to perform a variety of tasks, including time series forecasting. The flexible nature of these models allows them to be used for many applications. In this paper, we present a novel study of large language models used for the challenging task of time series anomaly detection. This problem entails two aspects novel for LLMs: the need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple parts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather than the traditional text input. We introduce sigllm, a framework for time series anomaly detection using large language models. Our framework includes a time-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that prompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection. We investigate two paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the detection task. First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly asks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies. Second, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to guide the anomaly detection process. We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets spanning various sources and 10 pipelines. We show that the forecasting method significantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect to the F1 score. Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant interest in their potential to support human experts across a range of domains, including public health. In this work we present automated evaluations of LLMs for public health tasks involving the classification and extraction of free text. We combine six externally annotated datasets with seven new internally annotated datasets to evaluate LLMs for processing text related to: health burden, epidemiological risk factors, and public health interventions. We initially evaluate five open-weight LLMs (7-70 billion parameters) across all tasks using zero-shot in-context learning. We find that Llama-3-70B-Instruct is the highest performing model, achieving the best results on 15/17 tasks (using micro-F1 scores). We see significant variation across tasks with all open-weight LLMs scoring below 60% micro-F1 on some challenging tasks, such as Contact Classification, while all LLMs achieve greater than 80% micro-F1 on others, such as GI Illness Classification. For a subset of 12 tasks, we also evaluate GPT-4 and find comparable results to Llama-3-70B-Instruct, which scores equally or outperforms GPT-4 on 6 of the 12 tasks. Overall, based on these initial results we find promising signs that LLMs may be useful tools for public health experts to extract information from a wide variety of free text sources, and support public health surveillance, research, and interventions.</li>

          Metric Flow Matching for Smooth Interpolations on the Data Manifold(https://arxiv.org/abs/)</code><input type="text"></li>
<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Matching objectives underpin the success of modern generative models and rely on constructing conditional paths that transform a source distribution into a target distribution. Despite being a fundamental building block, conditional paths have been designed principally under the assumption of Euclidean geometry, resulting in straight interpolations. However, this can be particularly restrictive for tasks such as trajectory inference, where straight paths might lie outside the data manifold, thus failing to capture the underlying dynamics giving rise to the observed marginals. In this paper, we propose Metric Flow Matching (MFM), a novel simulation-free framework for conditional flow matching where interpolants are approximate geodesics learned by minimizing the kinetic energy of a data-induced Riemannian metric. This way, the generative model matches vector fields on the data manifold, which corresponds to lower uncertainty and more meaningful interpolations. We prescribe general metrics to instantiate MFM, independent of the task, and test it on a suite of challenging problems including LiDAR navigation, unpaired image translation, and modeling cellular dynamics. We observe that MFM outperforms the Euclidean baselines, particularly achieving SOTA on single-cell trajectory prediction.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diffusion models have significantly improved the performance of image editing. Existing methods realize various approaches to achieve high-quality image editing, including but not limited to text control, dragging operation, and mask-and-inpainting. Among these, instruction-based editing stands out for its convenience and effectiveness in following human instructions across diverse scenarios. However, it still focuses on simple editing operations like adding, replacing, or deleting, and falls short of understanding aspects of world dynamics that convey the realistic dynamic nature in the physical world. Therefore, this work, EditWorld, introduces a new editing task, namely world-instructed image editing, which defines and categorizes the instructions grounded by various world scenarios. We curate a new image editing dataset with world instructions using a set of large pretrained models (e.g., GPT-3.5, Video-LLava and SDXL). To enable sufficient simulation of world dynamics for image editing, our EditWorld trains model in the curated dataset, and improves instruction-following ability with designed post-edit strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method significantly outperforms existing editing methods in this new task. Our dataset and code will be available at this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work explores the effectiveness of masked image modelling for learning representations of retinal OCT images. To this end, we leverage Masked Autoencoders (MAE), a simple and scalable method for self-supervised learning, to obtain a powerful and general representation for OCT images by training on 700K OCT images from 41K patients collected under real world clinical settings. We also provide the first extensive evaluation for a model of OCT on a challenging battery of 6 downstream tasks. Our model achieves strong performance when fully finetuned but can also serve as a versatile frozen feature extractor for many tasks using lightweight adapters. Furthermore, we propose an extension of the MAE pretraining to fuse OCT with an auxiliary modality, namely, IR fundus images and learn a joint model for both. We demonstrate our approach improves performance on a multimodal downstream application. Our experiments utilize most publicly available OCT datasets, thus enabling future comparisons.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose a novel approach called DIffusion-guided DIversity (DIDI) for offline behavioral generation. The goal of DIDI is to learn a diverse set of skills from a mixture of label-free offline data. We achieve this by leveraging diffusion probabilistic models as priors to guide the learning process and regularize the policy. By optimizing a joint objective that incorporates diversity and diffusion-guided regularization, we encourage the emergence of diverse behaviors while maintaining the similarity to the offline data. Experimental results in four decision-making domains (Push, Kitchen, Humanoid, and D4RL tasks) show that DIDI is effective in discovering diverse and discriminative skills. We also introduce skill stitching and skill interpolation, which highlight the generalist nature of the learned skill space. Further, by incorporating an extrinsic reward function, DIDI enables reward-guided behavior generation, facilitating the learning of diverse and optimal behaviors from sub-optimal data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>A plant growth simulation can be characterized as a reconstructed visual representation of a plant or plant system. The phenotypic characteristics and plant structures are controlled by the scene environment and other contextual attributes. Considering the temporal dependencies and compounding effects of various factors on growth trajectories, we formulate a probabilistic approach to the simulation task by solving a frame synthesis and pattern recognition problem. We introduce a Sequence-Informed Plant Growth Simulation framework (SI-PGS) that employs a conditional generative model to implicitly learn a distribution of possible plant representations within a dynamic scene from a fusion of low dimensional temporal sensor and context data. Methods such as controlled latent sampling and recurrent output connections are used to improve coherence in plant structures between frames of predictions. In this work, we demonstrate that SI-PGS is able to capture temporal dependencies and continuously generate realistic frames of a plant scene.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in the field of controllable image generation, while also coming along with issues of privacy leakage and data copyrights. Membership inference arises in these contexts as a potential auditing method for detecting unauthorized data usage. While some efforts have been made on diffusion models, they are not applicable to text-to-image diffusion models due to the high computation overhead and enhanced generalization capabilities. In this paper, we first identify a conditional overfitting phenomenon in text-to-image diffusion models, indicating that these models tend to overfit the conditional distribution of images given the text rather than the marginal distribution of images. Based on this observation, we derive an analytical indicator, namely Conditional Likelihood Discrepancy (CLiD), to perform membership inference. This indicator reduces the stochasticity in estimating the memorization of individual samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous methods across various data distributions and scales. Additionally, our method shows superior resistance to overfitting mitigation strategies such as early stopping and data augmentation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>To accelerate sampling, diffusion models (DMs) are often distilled into generators that directly map noise to data in a single step. In this approach, the resolution of the generator is fundamentally limited by that of the teacher DM. To overcome this limitation, we propose Progressive Growing of Diffusion Autoencoder (PaGoDA), a technique to progressively grow the resolution of the generator beyond that of the original teacher DM. Our key insight is that a pre-trained, low-resolution DM can be used to deterministically encode high-resolution data to a structured latent space by solving the PF-ODE forward in time (data-to-noise), starting from an appropriately down-sampled image. Using this frozen encoder in an auto-encoder framework, we train a decoder by progressively growing its resolution. From the nature of progressively growing decoder, PaGoDA avoids re-training teacher/student models when we upsample the student model, making the whole training pipeline much cheaper. In experiments, we used our progressively growing decoder to upsample from the pre-trained model's 64x64 resolution to generate 512x512 samples, achieving 2x faster inference compared to single-step distilled Stable Diffusion like LCM. PaGoDA also achieved state-of-the-art FIDs on ImageNet across all resolutions from 64x64 to 512x512. Additionally, we demonstrated PaGoDA's effectiveness in solving inverse problems and enabling controllable generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have facilitated creative and photorealistic image synthesis. By varying the random seeds, we can generate various images for a fixed text prompt. Technically, the seed controls the initial noise and, in multi-step diffusion inference, the noise used for reparameterization at intermediate timesteps in the reverse diffusion process. However, the specific impact of the random seed on the generated images remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we conduct a large-scale scientific study into the impact of random seeds during diffusion inference. Remarkably, we reveal that the best 'golden' seed achieved an impressive FID of 21.60, compared to the worst 'inferior' seed's FID of 31.97. Additionally, a classifier can predict the seed number used to generate an image with over 99.9% accuracy in just a few epochs, establishing that seeds are highly distinguishable based on generated images. Encouraged by these findings, we examined the influence of seeds on interpretable visual dimensions. We find that certain seeds consistently produce grayscale images, prominent sky regions, or image borders. Seeds also affect image composition, including object location, size, and depth. Moreover, by leveraging these 'golden' seeds, we demonstrate improved image generation such as high-fidelity inference and diversified sampling. Our investigation extends to inpainting tasks, where we uncover some seeds that tend to insert unwanted text artifacts. Overall, our extensive analyses highlight the importance of selecting good seeds and offer practical utility for image generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating high-quality 3D assets from text and images has long been challenging, primarily due to the absence of scalable 3D representations capable of capturing intricate geometry distributions. In this work, we introduce Direct3D, a native 3D generative model scalable to in-the-wild input images, without requiring a multiview diffusion model or SDS optimization. Our approach comprises two primary components: a Direct 3D Variational Auto-Encoder (D3D-VAE) and a Direct 3D Diffusion Transformer (D3D-DiT). D3D-VAE efficiently encodes high-resolution 3D shapes into a compact and continuous latent triplane space. Notably, our method directly supervises the decoded geometry using a semi-continuous surface sampling strategy, diverging from previous methods relying on rendered images as supervision signals. D3D-DiT models the distribution of encoded 3D latents and is specifically designed to fuse positional information from the three feature maps of the triplane latent, enabling a native 3D generative model scalable to large-scale 3D datasets. Additionally, we introduce an innovative image-to-3D generation pipeline incorporating semantic and pixel-level image conditions, allowing the model to produce 3D shapes consistent with the provided conditional image input. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our large-scale pre-trained Direct3D over previous image-to-3D approaches, achieving significantly better generation quality and generalization ability, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art for 3D content creation.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent developments in large-scale pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the generation of high-fidelity images, particularly with the emergence of diffusion models based on transformer architecture (DiTs). Among these diffusion models, diffusion transformers have demonstrated superior image generation capabilities, boosting lower FID scores and higher scalability. However, deploying large-scale DiT models can be expensive due to their extensive parameter numbers. Although existing research has explored efficient deployment techniques for diffusion models such as model quantization, there is still little work concerning DiT-based models. To tackle this research gap, in this paper, we propose TerDiT, a quantization-aware training (QAT) and efficient deployment scheme for ternary diffusion models with transformers. We focus on the ternarization of DiT networks and scale model sizes from 600M to 4.2B. Our work contributes to the exploration of efficient deployment strategies for large-scale DiT models, demonstrating the feasibility of training extremely low-bit diffusion transformer models from scratch while maintaining competitive image generation capacities compared to full-precision models.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We investigate the task of adapting image generative models to different datasets without finetuneing. To this end, we introduce Semantica, an image-conditioned diffusion model capable of generating images based on the semantics of a conditioning image. Semantica is trained exclusively on web-scale image pairs, that is it receives a random image from a webpage as conditional input and models another random image from the same webpage. Our experiments highlight the expressivity of pretrained image encoders and necessity of semantic-based data filtering in achieving high-quality image generation. Once trained, it can adaptively generate new images from a dataset by simply using images from that dataset as input. We study the transfer properties of Semantica on ImageNet, LSUN Churches, LSUN Bedroom and SUN397.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper investigates score-based diffusion models when the underlying target distribution is concentrated on or near low-dimensional manifolds within the higher-dimensional space in which they formally reside, a common characteristic of natural image distributions. Despite previous efforts to understand the data generation process of diffusion models, existing theoretical support remains highly suboptimal in the presence of low-dimensional structure, which we strengthen in this paper. For the popular Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), we find that the dependency of the error incurred within each denoising step on the ambient dimension $d$ is in general unavoidable. We further identify a unique design of coefficients that yields a converges rate at the order of $O(k^{2}/\sqrt{T})$ (up to log factors), where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution and $T$ is the number of steps. This represents the first theoretical demonstration that the DDPM sampler can adapt to unknown low-dimensional structures in the target distribution, highlighting the critical importance of coefficient design. All of this is achieved by a novel set of analysis tools that characterize the algorithmic dynamics in a more deterministic manner.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Video generation primarily aims to model authentic and customized motion across frames, making understanding and controlling the motion a crucial topic. Most diffusion-based studies on video motion focus on motion customization with training-based paradigms, which, however, demands substantial training resources and necessitates retraining for diverse models. Crucially, these approaches do not explore how video diffusion models encode cross-frame motion information in their features, lacking interpretability and transparency in their effectiveness. To answer this question, this paper introduces a novel perspective to understand, localize, and manipulate motion-aware features in video diffusion models. Through analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), our work discloses that robust motion-aware feature already exists in video diffusion models. We present a new MOtion FeaTure (MOFT) by eliminating content correlation information and filtering motion channels. MOFT provides a distinct set of benefits, including the ability to encode comprehensive motion information with clear interpretability, extraction without the need for training, and generalizability across diverse architectures. Leveraging MOFT, we propose a novel training-free video motion control framework. Our method demonstrates competitive performance in generating natural and faithful motion, providing architecture-agnostic insights and applicability in a variety of downstream tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent approaches have shown promises distilling diffusion models into efficient one-step generators. Among them, Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) produces one-step generators that match their teacher in distribution, without enforcing a one-to-one correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However, to ensure stable training, DMD requires an additional regression loss computed using a large set of noise-image pairs generated by the teacher with many steps of a deterministic sampler. This is costly for large-scale text-to-image synthesis and limits the student's quality, tying it too closely to the teacher's original sampling paths. We introduce DMD2, a set of techniques that lift this limitation and improve DMD training. First, we eliminate the regression loss and the need for expensive dataset construction. We show that the resulting instability is due to the fake critic not estimating the distribution of generated samples accurately and propose a two time-scale update rule as a remedy. Second, we integrate a GAN loss into the distillation procedure, discriminating between generated samples and real images. This lets us train the student model on real data, mitigating the imperfect real score estimation from the teacher model, and enhancing quality. Lastly, we modify the training procedure to enable multi-step sampling. We identify and address the training-inference input mismatch problem in this setting, by simulating inference-time generator samples during training time. Taken together, our improvements set new benchmarks in one-step image generation, with FID scores of 1.28 on ImageNet-64x64 and 8.35 on zero-shot COCO 2014, surpassing the original teacher despite a 500X reduction in inference cost. Further, we show our approach can generate megapixel images by distilling SDXL, demonstrating exceptional visual quality among few-step methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Accurate reconstruction of complex dynamic scenes from just a single viewpoint continues to be a challenging task in computer vision. Current dynamic novel view synthesis methods typically require videos from many different camera viewpoints, necessitating careful recording setups, and significantly restricting their utility in the wild as well as in terms of embodied AI applications. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{GCD}$, a controllable monocular dynamic view synthesis pipeline that leverages large-scale diffusion priors to, given a video of any scene, generate a synchronous video from any other chosen perspective, conditioned on a set of relative camera pose parameters. Our model does not require depth as input, and does not explicitly model 3D scene geometry, instead performing end-to-end video-to-video translation in order to achieve its goal efficiently. Despite being trained on synthetic multi-view video data only, zero-shot real-world generalization experiments show promising results in multiple domains, including robotics, object permanence, and driving environments. We believe our framework can potentially unlock powerful applications in rich dynamic scene understanding, perception for robotics, and interactive 3D video viewing experiences for virtual reality.</li>
