<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid growth of edge devices has driven the demand for deploying artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge, giving rise to Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) and its evolving counterpart, Tiny Deep Learning (TinyDL). While TinyML initially focused on enabling simple inference tasks on microcontrollers, the emergence of TinyDL marks a paradigm shift toward deploying deep learning models on severely resource-constrained hardware. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of the transition from TinyML to TinyDL, encompassing architectural innovations, hardware platforms, model optimization techniques, and software toolchains. We analyze state-of-the-art methods in quantization, pruning, and neural architecture search (NAS), and examine hardware trends from MCUs to dedicated neural accelerators. Furthermore, we categorize software deployment frameworks, compilers, and AutoML tools enabling practical on-device learning. Applications across domains such as computer vision, audio recognition, healthcare, and industrial monitoring are reviewed to illustrate the real-world impact of TinyDL. Finally, we identify emerging directions including neuromorphic computing, federated TinyDL, edge-native foundation models, and domain-specific co-design approaches. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners, offering a holistic view of the ecosystem and laying the groundwork for future advancements in edge AI.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) enables the precise delineation of regions within remote sensing imagery through natural language descriptions, serving critical applications in disaster response, urban development, and environmental monitoring. Despite recent advances, current approaches face significant challenges in processing aerial imagery due to complex object characteristics including scale variations, diverse orientations, and semantic ambiguities inherent to the overhead perspective. To address these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework introduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that dynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and object-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD) that iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise segmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general vision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD enables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature interaction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D, RefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms existing methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks. The significant performance improvements validate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for remote sensing applications through our proposed adaptive framework.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in large vision language models (LVLMs) have unlocked unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent responses from visual inputs. However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention while generating free-form textual responses remains a significant challenge, yet is essential for understanding model behavior, diagnosing hallucination, exposing bias and ensuring transparency. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight, model-agnostic framework for visualizing the salient image regions that LVLMs rely upon during open-ended visual question answering (VQA), while concurrently revealing the multimodal textual saliency. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to produce holistic response-level attribution heat maps for interpreting cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods in human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution, trace token-level reasoning dynamics, and analyze systematic human-attention misalignment, hallucination, and bias.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The quadratic computational complexity of self-attention in diffusion transformers (DiT) introduces substantial computational costs in high-resolution image generation. While the linear-complexity Mamba model emerges as a potential alternative, direct Mamba training remains empirically challenging. To address this issue, this paper introduces diffusion transformer-to-mamba distillation (T2MD), forming an efficient training pipeline that facilitates the transition from the self-attention-based transformer to the linear complexity state-space model Mamba. We establish a diffusion self-attention and Mamba hybrid model that simultaneously achieves efficiency and global dependencies. With the proposed layer-level teacher forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation, T2MD alleviates the training difficulty and high cost of a state space model from scratch. Starting from the distilled 512$\times$512 resolution base model, we push the generation towards 2048$\times$2048 images via lightweight adaptation and high-resolution fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our training path leads to low overhead but high-quality text-to-image generation. Importantly, our results also justify the feasibility of using sequential and causal Mamba models for generating non-causal visual output, suggesting the potential for future exploration.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Masked diffusion language models (MDLM) have shown strong promise for non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers act as implicit planners, selecting tokens to unmask via denoiser confidence or entropy scores. Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches (e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks - domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming Affective Computing (AC), with Vision Language Models (VLMs) now capable of recognising emotions in zero shot settings. This paper probes a critical but underexplored question: what visual cues do these models rely on to infer affect, and are these cues psychologically grounded or superficially learnt? We benchmark varying scale VLMs on a teeth annotated subset of AffectNet dataset and find consistent performance shifts depending on the presence of visible teeth. Through structured introspection of, the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, we show that facial attributes like eyebrow position drive much of its affective reasoning, revealing a high degree of internal consistency in its valence-arousal predictions. These patterns highlight the emergent nature of FMs behaviour, but also reveal risks: shortcut learning, bias, and fairness issues especially in sensitive domains like mental health and education.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Synthetic data generation creates data based on real-world data using generative models. In health applications, generating high-quality data while maintaining fairness for sensitive attributes is essential for equitable outcomes. Existing GAN-based and LLM-based methods focus on counterfactual fairness and are primarily applied in finance and legal domains. Causal fairness provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework by preserving causal structure, but current synthetic data generation methods do not address it in health settings. To fill this gap, we develop the first LLM-augmented synthetic data generation method to enhance causal fairness using real-world tabular health data. Our generated data deviates by less than 10% from real data on causal fairness metrics. When trained on causally fair predictors, synthetic data reduces bias on the sensitive attribute by 70% compared to real data. This work improves access to fair synthetic data, supporting equitable health research and healthcare delivery.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in AI weather forecasting have led to the emergence of so-called "foundation models", typically defined by expensive pretraining and minimal fine-tuning for downstream tasks. However, in the natural sciences, a desirable foundation model should also encode meaningful statistical relationships between the underlying physical variables. This study evaluates the performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting hydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We introduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent representations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables. As a baseline, we compare this to fine-tuning the full model, which allows further optimization of the latent space while incorporating new variables into both inputs and outputs. The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time and 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various hydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation model, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on the physical correlation between the new variables and those used during pretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical relationships. In this sense, we argue that an important quality metric for foundation models in Earth sciences is their ability to be extended to new variables without a full fine-tuning. This provides a new perspective for making foundation models more accessible to communities with limited computational resources, while supporting broader adoption in Earth sciences.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in image editing with diffusion models have achieved impressive results, offering fine-grained control over the generation process. However, these methods are computationally intensive because of their iterative nature. While distilled diffusion models enable faster inference, their editing capabilities remain limited, primarily because of poor inversion quality. High-fidelity inversion and reconstruction are essential for precise image editing, as they preserve the structural and semantic integrity of the source image. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances image inversion using consistency models, enabling high-quality editing in just four steps. Our method introduces a cycle-consistency optimization strategy that significantly improves reconstruction accuracy and enables a controllable trade-off between editability and content preservation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across various image editing tasks and datasets, demonstrating that our method matches or surpasses full-step diffusion models while being substantially more efficient. The code of our method is available on GitHub at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale 3D semantic scene generation has predominantly relied on voxel-based representations, which are memory-intensive, bound by fixed resolutions, and challenging to edit. In contrast, primitives represent semantic entities using compact, coarse 3D structures that are easy to manipulate and compose, making them an ideal representation for this task. In this paper, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion-based framework that leverages primitives as the main foundational elements for generating compositional, controllable, and editable 3D semantic scene layouts. Our method adopts a hybrid representation, modeling ground surfaces in a rasterized format while encoding objects as vectorized 3D primitives. This decomposition is also reflected in a structured latent representation that enables flexible scene manipulation of ground and object components. To overcome the orientation ambiguities in conventional encoding methods, we introduce a stable Cholesky-based parameterization that jointly encodes object size and orientation. Experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that PrITTI outperforms a voxel-based baseline in generation quality, while reducing memory requirements by up to $3\times$. In addition, PrITTI enables direct instance-level manipulation of objects in the scene and supports a range of downstream applications, including scene inpainting, outpainting, and photo-realistic street-view synthesis.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Riemannian representation learning typically relies on approximating densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing difficult objectives, potentially harming models. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce the Riemannian generative decoder which finds manifold-valued maximum likelihood latents with a Riemannian optimizer while training a decoder network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds. We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure. Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures, and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned via a local learning rule. The gradient with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol are computed directly from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration, we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a network of 10x10 oscillators to sample images of 0s and 1s from the MNIST dataset.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>LLMs are typically trained in high-resource languages, and tasks in lower-resourced languages tend to underperform the higher-resource language counterparts for in-context learning. Despite the large body of work on prompting settings, it is still unclear how LLMs should be adapted cross-lingually specifically for in-context learning in the low-resource target languages. We perform a comprehensive study spanning five diverse target languages, three base LLMs, and seven downstream tasks spanning over 4,100 GPU training hours (9,900+ TFLOPs) across various adaptation techniques: few-shot prompting, translate-test, fine-tuning, embedding re-initialization, and instruction fine-tuning. Our results show that the few-shot prompting and translate-test settings tend to heavily outperform the gradient-based adaptation methods. To better understand this discrepancy, we design a novel metric, Valid Output Recall (VOR), and analyze model outputs to empirically attribute the degradation of these trained models to catastrophic forgetting. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the largest study done on in-context learning for low-resource languages with respect to train compute and number of adaptation techniques considered. We make all our datasets and trained models available for public use.</li>

The proposed method combines the distributed collaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature discrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding representations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample pairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space. Without exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a federated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to represent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system logs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both contrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect fine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical attack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario to examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It demonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing complex anomalies in distributed environments. Through careful design of key modules and optimization of the training mechanism, the proposed method achieves a balance between privacy preservation and detection performance. It offers a feasible technical path for intelligent security management in distributed systems.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>While the efficacy of deep learning models heavily relies on data, gathering and annotating data for specific tasks, particularly when addressing novel or sensitive subjects lacking relevant datasets, poses significant time and resource challenges. In response to this, we propose a novel Automated Image Recognition (AIR) framework that harnesses the power of generative AI. AIR empowers end-users to synthesize high-quality, pre-annotated datasets, eliminating the necessity for manual labeling. It also automatically trains deep learning models on the generated datasets with robust image recognition performance. Our framework includes two main data synthesis processes, AIR-Gen and AIR-Aug. The AIR-Gen enables end-users to seamlessly generate datasets tailored to their specifications. To improve image quality, we introduce a novel automated prompt engineering module that leverages the capabilities of large language models. We also introduce a distribution adjustment algorithm to eliminate duplicates and outliers, enhancing the robustness and reliability of generated datasets. On the other hand, the AIR-Aug enhances a given dataset, thereby improving the performance of deep classifier models. AIR-Aug is particularly beneficial when users have limited data for specific tasks. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the efficacy of our generated data in training deep learning models and showcased the system's potential to provide image recognition models for a wide range of objects. We also conducted a user study that achieved an impressive score of 4.4 out of 5.0, underscoring the AI community's positive perception of AIR.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the remarkable generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs), using LLM-generated data to train downstream models has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate data scarcity in specific domains and reduce time-consuming annotations. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical issue: iterative training on self-generated data results in model collapse, where model performance degrades over time. Despite extensive research on the implications of LLM-generated data, these works often neglect the importance of data diversity, a key factor in data quality. In this work, we aim to understand the implications of the diversity of LLM-generated data on downstream model performance. Specifically, we explore how varying levels of diversity in LLM-generated data affect downstream model performance. Additionally, we investigate the performance of models trained on data that mixes different proportions of LLM-generated data, which we refer to as synthetic data. Our experimental results show that, with minimal distribution shift, moderately diverse LLM-generated data can enhance model performance in scenarios with insufficient labeled data, whereas highly diverse generated data has a negative impact. We hope our empirical findings will offer valuable guidance for future studies on LLMs as data generators.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traditional fundus image analysis models focus on single-modal tasks, ignoring fundus modality complementarity, which limits their versatility. Recently, retinal foundation models have emerged, but most still remain modality-specific. Integrating multiple fundus imaging modalities into a single foundation model is valuable. However, in dynamic environments, data from different modalities often arrive incrementally, necessitating continual pre-training. To address this, we propose RetCoP, the first continual vision-language pre-training framework in the fundus domain, which incrementally integrates image and text features from different imaging modalities into a single unified foundation model. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual pre-training, we introduce a rehearsal strategy utilizing representative image-text pairs and an off-diagonal information distillation approach. The former allows the model to revisit knowledge from previous stages, while the latter explicitly preserves the alignment between image and text representations. Experiments show that RetCoP outperforms all the compared methods, achieving the best generalization and lowest forgetting rate. The code can be found at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Masked Graph Auto-Encoder, a powerful graph self-supervised training paradigm, has recently shown superior performance in graph representation learning. Existing works typically rely on node contextual information to recover the masked information. However, they fail to generalize well to heterophilic graphs where connected nodes may be not similar, because they focus only on capturing the neighborhood information and ignoring the discrepancy information between different nodes, resulting in indistinguishable node representations. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE). It obtains more distinguishable node representations by reconstructing the discrepancy information of neighboring nodes during the masking process. We conduct extensive experiments on 17 widely-used benchmark datasets. The results show that our DGMAE can effectively preserve the discrepancies of nodes in low-dimensional space. Moreover, DGMAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph self-supervised learning methods on three graph analytic including tasks node classification, node clustering, and graph classification, demonstrating its remarkable superiority.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Distilled video generation models offer fast and efficient synthesis but struggle with motion customization when guided by reference videos, especially under training-free settings. Existing training-free methods, originally designed for standard diffusion models, fail to generalize due to the accelerated generative process and large denoising steps in distilled models. To address this, we propose MotionEcho, a novel training-free test-time distillation framework that enables motion customization by leveraging diffusion teacher forcing. Our approach uses high-quality, slow teacher models to guide the inference of fast student models through endpoint prediction and interpolation. To maintain efficiency, we dynamically allocate computation across timesteps according to guidance needs. Extensive experiments across various distilled video generation models and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion fidelity and generation quality while preserving high efficiency.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In-context learning (ICL) enables transformers to adapt to new tasks through contextual examples without parameter updates. While existing research has typically studied ICL in fixed-complexity environments, practical language models encounter tasks spanning diverse complexity levels. This paper investigates how transformers navigate hierarchical task structures where higher-complexity categories can perfectly represent any pattern generated by simpler ones. We design well-controlled testbeds based on Markov chains and linear regression that reveal transformers not only identify the appropriate complexity level for each task but also accurately infer the corresponding parameters--even when the in-context examples are compatible with multiple complexity hypotheses. Notably, when presented with data generated by simpler processes, transformers consistently favor the least complex sufficient explanation. We theoretically explain this behavior through a Bayesian framework, demonstrating that transformers effectively implement an in-context Bayesian Occam's razor by balancing model fit against complexity penalties. We further ablate on the roles of model size, training mixture distribution, inference context length, and architecture. Finally, we validate this Occam's razor-like inductive bias on a pretrained GPT-4 model with Boolean-function tasks as case study, suggesting it may be inherent to transformers trained on diverse task distributions.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advances in generative models have transformed the field of synthetic image generation for privacy-preserving data synthesis (PPDS). However, the field lacks a comprehensive survey and comparison of synthetic image generation methods across diverse settings. In particular, when we generate synthetic images for the purpose of training a classifier, there is a pipeline of generation-sampling-classification which takes private training as input and outputs the final classifier of interest. In this survey, we systematically categorize existing image synthesis methods, privacy attacks, and mitigations along this generation-sampling-classification pipeline. To empirically compare diverse synthesis approaches, we provide a benchmark with representative generative methods and use model-agnostic membership inference attacks (MIAs) as a measure of privacy risk. Through this study, we seek to answer critical questions in PPDS: Can synthetic data effectively replace real data? Which release strategy balances utility and privacy? Do mitigations improve the utility-privacy tradeoff? Which generative models perform best across different scenarios? With a systematic evaluation of diverse methods, our study provides actionable insights into the utility-privacy tradeoffs of synthetic data generation methods and guides the decision on optimal data releasing strategies for real-world applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Electromagnetic structure (EMS) design plays a critical role in developing advanced antennas and materials, but remains challenging due to high-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations. While existing methods commonly employ high-quality predictors or generators to alleviate evaluations, they are often data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale and budget constraints. To address this, we propose a novel method called Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the high-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a quadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from global patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly accurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection mechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing exploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs. We evaluate PQS on two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective Surface and High-gain Antenna. Experimental results show that our method can achieve satisfactory designs under limited computational budgets, outperforming baseline methods. In particular, compared to generative approaches, it cuts evaluation costs by 75-85%, effectively saving 20.27-38.80 days of product designing cycle.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Downscaling is essential for generating the high-resolution climate data needed for local planning, but traditional methods remain computationally demanding. Recent years have seen impressive results from AI downscaling models, particularly diffusion models, which have attracted attention due to their ability to generate ensembles and overcome the smoothing problem common in other AI methods. However, these models typically remain computationally intensive. We introduce a Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) model, which introduces an easily-extensible hierarchical sampling process to the diffusion framework. A coarse-to-fine hierarchy is imposed via a simple downsampling scheme. HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6 models, significantly reducing computational load by running on up to half as many pixels with competitive results. Additionally, a single model trained at 0.25° resolution transfers seamlessly across multiple CMIP6 models with much coarser resolution. HDD thus offers a lightweight alternative for probabilistic climate downscaling, facilitating affordable large-ensemble high-resolution climate projections.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns, limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data. Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets, enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11% reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a 10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real training sets are not available.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) affects nearly half of diabetes patients, requiring early detection. Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) enables non-invasive diagnosis, but automated methods suffer from inefficient feature extraction, reliance on handcrafted priors, and data limitations. We propose HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer (HMSViT) designed for corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis. Unlike existing methods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention mechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale feature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and integrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost. A block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT that reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a multi-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing hierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like the Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation accuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal that integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature extraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional supervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that HMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating its potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Simulation is crucial for developing and evaluating autonomous vehicle (AV) systems. Recent literature builds on a new generation of generative models to synthesize highly realistic images for full-stack simulation. However, purely synthetically generated scenes are not grounded in reality and have difficulty in inspiring confidence in the relevance of its outcomes. Editing models, on the other hand, leverage source scenes from real driving logs, and enable the simulation of different traffic layouts, behaviors, and operating conditions such as weather and time of day. While image editing is an established topic in computer vision, it presents fresh sets of challenges in driving simulation: (1) the need for cross-camera 3D consistency, (2) learning ``empty street" priors from driving data with foreground occlusions, and (3) obtaining paired image tuples of varied editing conditions while preserving consistent layout and geometry. To address these challenges, we propose SceneCrafter, a versatile editor for realistic 3D-consistent manipulation of driving scenes captured from multiple cameras. We build on recent advancements in multi-view diffusion models, using a fully controllable framework that scales seamlessly to multi-modality conditions like weather, time of day, agent boxes and high-definition maps. To generate paired data for supervising the editing model, we propose a novel framework on top of Prompt-to-Prompt to generate geometrically consistent synthetic paired data with global edits. We also introduce an alpha-blending framework to synthesize data with local edits, leveraging a model trained on empty street priors through novel masked training and multi-view repaint paradigm. SceneCrafter demonstrates powerful editing capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D consistency, and scene editing quality compared to existing baselines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With access to large-scale, unlabeled medical datasets, researchers are confronted with two questions: Should they attempt to pretrain a custom foundation model on this medical data, or use transfer-learning from an existing generalist model? And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel methods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a case-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal ultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2 method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification, segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and little methodological adaptation. Given these findings, we argue that a bias towards methodological innovation should be avoided when developing domain specific foundation models under common computational resource constraints.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>From optical sensors to microwave radars, leveraging the complementary strengths of remote sensing (RS) sensors is crucial for achieving dense spatio-temporal monitoring of our planet. In contrast, recent deep learning models, whether task-specific or foundational, are often specific to single sensors or to fixed combinations: adapting such models to different sensory inputs requires both architectural changes and re-training, limiting scalability and generalization across multiple RS sensors. On the contrary, a single model able to modulate its feature representations to accept diverse sensors as input would pave the way to agile and flexible multi-sensor RS data processing. To address this, we introduce SMARTIES, a generic and versatile foundation model lifting sensor-specific/dependent efforts and enabling scalability and generalization to diverse RS sensors: SMARTIES projects data from heterogeneous sensors into a shared spectrum-aware space, enabling the use of arbitrary combinations of bands both for training and inference. To obtain sensor-agnostic representations, we train a single, unified transformer model reconstructing masked multi-sensor data with cross-sensor token mixup. On both single- and multi-modal tasks across diverse sensors, SMARTIES outperforms previous models that rely on sensor-specific pretraining.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we propose a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based framework, referred to as Novel View Synthesis Framework (NVSF). It jointly learns the implicit neural representation of space and time-varying scene for both LiDAR and Camera. We test this on a real-world autonomous driving scenario containing both static and dynamic scenes. Compared to existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs, our framework is self-supervised, thus eliminating the need for 3D labels. For efficient training and faster convergence, we introduce heuristic-based image pixel sampling to focus on pixels with rich information. To preserve the local features of LiDAR points, a Double Gradient based mask is employed. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that, compared to the baseline models, our framework has reported best performance on both LiDAR and Camera domain.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Although new vision foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have significantly enhanced zero-shot image segmentation capabilities, reliance on human-provided prompts poses significant challenges in adapting SAM2 to medical image segmentation tasks. Moreover, SAM2's performance in medical image segmentation was limited by the domain shift issue, since it was originally trained on natural images and videos. To address these challenges, we proposed SAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated the need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism of SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via a Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel Pseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to automatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction by guiding attention to relevant areas. Furthermore, a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) strategy was adopted to mitigate the domain shift issue. The proposed framework was evaluated on both 2D and 3D datasets across multiple medical imaging modalities, including fundus photography, X-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and ultrasound. The results demonstrated a significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art models, such as nnUNet and SwinUNet, as well as foundation models, such as SAM2 and MedSAM2, underscoring the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Precision oncology requires accurate molecular insights, yet obtaining these directly from genomics is costly and time-consuming for broad clinical use. Predicting complex molecular features and patient prognosis directly from routine whole-slide images (WSI) remains a major challenge for current deep learning methods. Here we introduce PathLUPI, which uses transcriptomic privileged information during training to extract genome-anchored histological embeddings, enabling effective molecular prediction using only WSIs at inference. Through extensive evaluation across 49 molecular oncology tasks using 11,257 cases among 20 cohorts, PathLUPI demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional methods trained solely on WSIs. Crucially, it achieves AUC $\geq$ 0.80 in 14 of the biomarker prediction and molecular subtyping tasks and C-index $\geq$ 0.70 in survival cohorts of 5 major cancer types. Moreover, PathLUPI embeddings reveal distinct cellular morphological signatures associated with specific genotypes and related biological pathways within WSIs. By effectively encoding molecular context to refine WSI representations, PathLUPI overcomes a key limitation of existing models and offers a novel strategy to bridge molecular insights with routine pathology workflows for wider clinical application.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>anomaly</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Precise anomaly detection in medical images is critical for clinical decision-making. While recent unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection methods trained on large-scale normal data show promising results, they lack fine-grained differentiation, such as benign vs. malignant tumors. Additionally, ultrasound (US) imaging is highly sensitive to devices and acquisition parameter variations, creating significant domain gaps in the resulting US images. To address these challenges, we propose UltraAD, a vision-language model (VLM)-based approach that leverages few-shot US examples for generalized anomaly localization and fine-grained classification. To enhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual prototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed prompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining local representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a memory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text descriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features. During training, the stored text embeddings remain frozen, while image features are adapted to better align with medical data. UltraAD has been extensively evaluated on three breast US datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both lesion localization and fine-grained medical classification. The code will be released upon acceptance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern conditional diffusion models. Although highly effective in practice, the underlying mechanisms by which CFG enhances quality, detail, and prompt alignment are not fully understood. We present a novel perspective on CFG by analyzing its effects in the frequency domain, showing that low and high frequencies have distinct impacts on generation quality. Specifically, low-frequency guidance governs global structure and condition alignment, while high-frequency guidance mainly enhances visual fidelity. However, applying a uniform scale across all frequencies -- as is done in standard CFG -- leads to oversaturation and reduced diversity at high scales and degraded visual quality at low scales. Based on these insights, we propose frequency-decoupled guidance (FDG), an effective approach that decomposes CFG into low- and high-frequency components and applies separate guidance strengths to each component. FDG improves image quality at low guidance scales and avoids the drawbacks of high CFG scales by design. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets and models, we demonstrate that FDG consistently enhances sample fidelity while preserving diversity, leading to improved FID and recall compared to CFG, establishing our method as a plug-and-play alternative to standard classifier-free guidance.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Neural networks now generate text, images, and speech with billions of parameters, producing a need to know how each neural unit contributes to these high-dimensional outputs. Existing explainable-AI methods, such as SHAP, attribute importance to inputs, but cannot quantify the contributions of neural units across thousands of output pixels, tokens, or logits. Here we close that gap with Multiperturbation Shapley-value Analysis (MSA), a model-agnostic game-theoretic framework. By systematically lesioning combinations of units, MSA yields Shapley Modes, unit-wise contribution maps that share the exact dimensionality of the model's output. We apply MSA across scales, from multi-layer perceptrons to the 56-billion-parameter Mixtral-8x7B and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The approach demonstrates how regularisation concentrates computation in a few hubs, exposes language-specific experts inside the LLM, and reveals an inverted pixel-generation hierarchy in GANs. Together, these results showcase MSA as a powerful approach for interpreting, editing, and compressing deep neural networks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency, adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints, semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge. Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular, data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass, surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both generation quality and computational efficiency.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing 4D synthesis methods primarily focus on object-level generation or dynamic scene synthesis with limited novel views, restricting their ability to generate multi-view consistent and immersive dynamic 4D scenes. To address these constraints, we propose a framework (dubbed as CoCo4D) for generating detailed dynamic 4D scenes from text prompts, with the option to include images. Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion typically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are less pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two responsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving background, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt and an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion sequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the synthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a novel progressive outpainting scheme. To ensure seamless integration of the moving foreground object within the dynamic background, CoCo4D optimizes a parametric trajectory for the foreground, resulting in realistic and coherent blending. Extensive experiments show that CoCo4D achieves comparable or superior performance in 4D scene generation compared to existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Differential privacy (DP) has become the standard for private data analysis. Certain machine learning applications only require privacy protection for specific protected attributes. Using naive variants of differential privacy in such use cases can result in unnecessary degradation of utility. In this work, we refine the definition of DP to create a more general and flexible framework that we call feature differential privacy (FDP). Our definition is simulation-based and allows for both addition/removal and replacement variants of privacy, and can handle arbitrary and adaptive separation of protected and non-protected features. We prove the properties of FDP, such as adaptive composition, and demonstrate its implications for limiting attribute inference attacks. We also propose a modification of the standard DP-SGD algorithm that satisfies FDP while leveraging desirable properties such as amplification via sub-sampling. We apply our framework to various machine learning tasks and show that it can significantly improve the utility of DP-trained models when public features are available. For example, we train diffusion models on the AFHQ dataset of animal faces and observe a drastic improvement in FID compared to DP, from 286.7 to 101.9 at $\epsilon=8$, assuming that the blurred version of a training image is available as a public feature. Overall, our work provides a new approach to private data analysis that can help reduce the utility cost of DP while still providing strong privacy guarantees.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output. In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2) noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating high-dimensional visual modalities is a computationally intensive task. A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner. While diffusion models benefit from the coarse-to-fine nature of denoising, explicit multi-stage architectures are rarely adopted. These architectures have increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions, add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid). As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under the same training compute. When applied to finetuning of large models, such as FLUX, DFM shows faster convergence speed to the training distribution. Crucially, all these advantages are achieved with a single model, architectural simplicity, and minimal modifications to existing training pipelines.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have exhibited remarkable capabilities in diverse video generation. However, existing solutions face several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes (storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images. We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training. Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible human-scene interaction from a single image scene.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.</li>

In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers video-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated meshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view, multi-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on template renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional encodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment between video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to motion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are triangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via inverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged sequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution for category-agnostic 3D animation.

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to 4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.</li>
