<li>Summary: <p>Estimating the 6D object pose from a single RGB image often involves noise
and indeterminacy due to challenges such as occlusions and cluttered
backgrounds. Meanwhile, diffusion models have shown appealing performance in
generating high-quality images from random noise with high indeterminacy
through step-by-step denoising. Inspired by their denoising capability, we
propose a novel diffusion-based framework (6D-Diff) to handle the noise and
indeterminacy in object pose estimation for better performance. In our
framework, to establish accurate 2D-3D correspondence, we formulate 2D
keypoints detection as a reverse diffusion (denoising) process. To facilitate
such a denoising process, we design a Mixture-of-Cauchy-based forward diffusion
process and condition the reverse process on the object features. Extensive
experiments on the LM-O and YCB-V datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework.

<li>Summary: <p>The recent progress in language-based open-vocabulary object detection can be
largely attributed to finding better ways of leveraging large-scale data with
free-form text annotations. Training such models with a discriminative
objective function has proven successful, but requires good positive and
negative samples. However, the free-form nature and the open vocabulary of
object descriptions make the space of negatives extremely large. Prior works
randomly sample negatives or use rule-based techniques to build them. In
contrast, we propose to leverage the vast knowledge built into modern
generative models to automatically build negatives that are more relevant to
the original data. Specifically, we use large-language-models to generate
negative text descriptions, and text-to-image diffusion models to also generate
corresponding negative images. Our experimental analysis confirms the relevance
of the generated negative data, and its use in language-based detectors
improves performance on two complex benchmarks.

<li>Summary: <p>Diffusion models trained with mean squared error loss tend to generate
unrealistic samples. Current state-of-the-art models rely on classifier-free
guidance to improve sample quality, yet its surprising effectiveness is not
fully understood. In this paper, We show that the effectiveness of
classifier-free guidance partly originates from it being a form of implicit
perceptual guidance. As a result, we can directly incorporate perceptual loss
in diffusion training to improve sample quality. Since the score matching
objective used in diffusion training strongly resembles the denoising
autoencoder objective used in unsupervised training of perceptual networks, the
diffusion model itself is a perceptual network and can be used to generate
meaningful perceptual loss. We propose a novel self-perceptual objective that
results in diffusion models capable of generating more realistic samples. For
conditional generation, our method only improves sample quality without
entanglement with the conditional input and therefore does not sacrifice sample
diversity. Our method can also improve sample quality for unconditional
generation, which was not possible with classifier-free guidance before.

<li>Summary: <p>Current Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can generate photorealistic novel
views. For editing 3D scenes represented by NeRF, with the advent of generative
models, this paper proposes Inpaint4DNeRF to capitalize on state-of-the-art
stable diffusion models (e.g., ControlNet) for direct generation of the
underlying completed background content, regardless of static or dynamic. The
key advantages of this generative approach for NeRF inpainting are twofold.
First, after rough mask propagation, to complete or fill in previously occluded
content, we can individually generate a small subset of completed images with
plausible content, called seed images, from which simple 3D geometry proxies
can be derived. Second and the remaining problem is thus 3D multiview
consistency among all completed images, now guided by the seed images and their
3D proxies. Without other bells and whistles, our generative Inpaint4DNeRF
baseline framework is general which can be readily extended to 4D dynamic
NeRFs, where temporal consistency can be naturally handled in a similar way as
our multiview consistency.

<li>Summary: <p>Numerical simulations can model the physical processes that govern
cardiovascular device deployment. When such simulations incorporate digital
twins; computational models of patient-specific anatomy, they can expedite and
de-risk the device design process. Nonetheless, the exclusive use of
patient-specific data constrains the anatomic variability which can be
precisely or fully explored. In this study, we investigate the capacity of
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to edit digital twins to create anatomic
variants, which we term digital siblings. Digital twins and their corresponding
siblings can serve as the basis for comparative simulations, enabling the study
of how subtle anatomic variations impact the simulated deployment of
cardiovascular devices, as well as the augmentation of virtual cohorts for
device assessment. However, while diffusion models have been characterized in
their ability to edit natural images, their capacity to anatomically edit
digital twins has yet to be studied. Using a case example centered on 3D
digital twins of cardiac anatomy, we implement various methods for generating
digital siblings and characterize them through morphological and topological
analyses. We specifically edit digital twins to introduce anatomic variation at
different spatial scales and within localized regions, demonstrating the
existence of bias towards common anatomic features. We further show that such
anatomic bias can be leveraged for virtual cohort augmentation through
selective editing, partially alleviating issues related to dataset imbalance
and lack of diversity. Our experimental framework thus delineates the limits
and capabilities of using latent diffusion models in synthesizing anatomic
variation for in silico trials.

<h3>Title: Is It Possible to Backdoor Face Forgery Detection with Natural Triggers?. (arXiv:2401.00414v1 [cs.CV])</h3>

<li>Summary: <p>Deep neural networks have significantly improved the performance of face
forgery detection models in discriminating Artificial Intelligent Generated
Content (AIGC). However, their security is significantly threatened by the
injection of triggers during model training (i.e., backdoor attacks). Although
existing backdoor defenses and manual data selection can mitigate those using
human-eye-sensitive triggers, such as patches or adversarial noises, the more
challenging natural backdoor triggers remain insufficiently researched. To
further investigate natural triggers, we propose a novel analysis-by-synthesis
backdoor attack against face forgery detection models, which embeds natural
triggers in the latent space. We thoroughly study such backdoor vulnerability
from two perspectives: (1) Model Discrimination (Optimization-Based Trigger):
we adopt a substitute detection model and find the trigger by minimizing the
cross-entropy loss; (2) Data Distribution (Custom Trigger): we manipulate the
uncommon facial attributes in the long-tailed distribution to generate poisoned
samples without the supervision from detection models. Furthermore, to
completely evaluate the detection models towards the latest AIGC, we utilize
both state-of-the-art StyleGAN and Stable Diffusion for trigger generation.
Finally, these backdoor triggers introduce specific semantic features to the
generated poisoned samples (e.g., skin textures and smile), which are more
natural and robust. Extensive experiments show that our method is superior from
three levels: (1) Attack Success Rate: ours achieves a high attack success rate
(over 99%) and incurs a small model accuracy drop (below 0.2%) with a low
poisoning rate (less than 3%); (2) Backdoor Defense: ours shows better robust
performance when faced with existing backdoor defense methods; (3) Human
Inspection: ours is less human-eye-sensitive from a comprehensive user study.

<li>Summary: <p>In cross-domain retrieval, a model is required to identify images from the
same semantic category across two visual domains. For instance, given a sketch
of an object, a model needs to retrieve a real image of it from an online
store's catalog. A standard approach for such a problem is learning a feature
space of images where Euclidean distances reflect similarity. Even without
human annotations, which may be expensive to acquire, prior methods function
reasonably well using unlabeled images for training. Our problem constraint
takes this further to scenarios where the two domains do not necessarily share
any common categories in training data. This can occur when the two domains in
question come from different versions of some biometric sensor recording
identities of different people. We posit a simple solution, which is to
generate synthetic data to fill in these missing category examples across
domains. This, we do via category preserving translation of images from one
visual domain to another. We compare approaches specifically trained for this
translation for a pair of domains, as well as those that can use large-scale
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models via prompts, and find that the
latter can generate better replacement synthetic data, leading to more accurate
cross-domain retrieval models. Code for our work is available at

<li>Summary: <p>Efficiently finding optimal correspondences between point clouds is crucial
for solving both rigid and non-rigid point cloud registration problems.
Existing methods often rely on geometric or semantic feature embedding to
establish correspondences and estimate transformations or flow fields.
Recently, state-of-the-art methods have employed RAFT-like iterative updates to
refine the solution. However, these methods have certain limitations. Firstly,
their iterative refinement design lacks transparency, and their iterative
updates follow a fixed path during the refinement process, which can lead to
suboptimal results. Secondly, these methods overlook the importance of refining
or optimizing correspondences (or matching matrices) as a precursor to solving
transformations or flow fields. They typically compute candidate
correspondences based on distances in the point feature space. However, they
only project the candidate matching matrix into some matrix space once with
Sinkhorn or dual softmax operations to obtain final correspondences. This
one-shot projected matching matrix may be far from the globally optimal one,
and these approaches do not consider the distribution of the target matching
matrix. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that exploits the Denoising
Diffusion Model to predict a searching gradient for the optimal matching matrix
within the Doubly Stochastic Matrix Space. During the reverse denoising
process, our method iteratively searches for better solutions along this
denoising gradient, which points towards the maximum likelihood direction of
the target matching matrix. Our method offers flexibility by allowing the
search to start from any initial matching matrix provided by the online
backbone or white noise. Experimental evaluations on the 3DMatch/3DLoMatch and
4DMatch/4DLoMatch datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly designed
framework.

<li>Summary: <p>This work presents FaceX framework, a novel facial generalist model capable
of handling diverse facial tasks simultaneously. To achieve this goal, we
initially formulate a unified facial representation for a broad spectrum of
facial editing tasks, which macroscopically decomposes a face into fundamental
identity, intra-personal variation, and environmental factors. Based on this,
we introduce Facial Omni-Representation Decomposing (FORD) for seamless
manipulation of various facial components, microscopically decomposing the core
aspects of most facial editing tasks. Furthermore, by leveraging the prior of a
pretrained StableDiffusion (SD) to enhance generation quality and accelerate
training, we design Facial Omni-Representation Steering (FORS) to first
assemble unified facial representations and then effectively steer the SD-aware
generation process by the efficient Facial Representation Controller (FRC).
%Without any additional features, Our versatile FaceX achieves competitive
performance compared to elaborate task-specific models on popular facial
editing tasks. Full codes and models will be available at

<li>Summary: <p>In this paper, we focus on the One-shot Novel View Synthesis (O-NVS) task
which targets synthesizing photo-realistic novel views given only one reference
image per scene. Previous One-shot Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields
(OG-NeRF) methods solve this task in an inference-time finetuning-free manner,
yet suffer the blurry issue due to the encoder-only architecture that highly
relies on the limited reference image. On the other hand, recent
diffusion-based image-to-3d methods show vivid plausible results via distilling
pre-trained 2D diffusion models into a 3D representation, yet require tedious
per-scene optimization. Targeting these issues, we propose the GD^2-NeRF, a
Generative Detail compensation framework via GAN and Diffusion that is both
inference-time finetuning-free and with vivid plausible details. In detail,
following a coarse-to-fine strategy, GD^2-NeRF is mainly composed of a
One-stage Parallel Pipeline (OPP) and a 3D-consistent Detail Enhancer
(Diff3DE). At the coarse stage, OPP first efficiently inserts the GAN model
into the existing OG-NeRF pipeline for primarily relieving the blurry issue
with in-distribution priors captured from the training dataset, achieving a
good balance between sharpness (LPIPS, FID) and fidelity (PSNR, SSIM). Then, at
the fine stage, Diff3DE further leverages the pre-trained image diffusion
models to complement rich out-distribution details while maintaining decent 3D
consistency. Extensive experiments on both the synthetic and real-world
datasets show that GD$^2$-NeRF noticeably improves the details while without
per-scene finetuning.

<li>Summary: <p>Diffusion Models (DMs) represent a significant advancement in image
Super-Resolution (SR), aligning technical image quality more closely with human
preferences and expanding SR applications. DMs address critical limitations of
previous methods, enhancing overall realism and details in SR images. However,
DMs suffer from color-shifting issues, and their high computational costs call
for efficient sampling alternatives, underscoring the challenge of balancing
computational efficiency and image quality. This survey gives an overview of
DMs applied to image SR and offers a detailed analysis that underscores the
unique characteristics and methodologies within this domain, distinct from
broader existing reviews in the field. It presents a unified view of DM
fundamentals and explores research directions, including alternative input
domains, conditioning strategies, guidance, corruption spaces, and zero-shot
methods. This survey provides insights into the evolution of image SR with DMs,
addressing current trends, challenges, and future directions in this rapidly

<li>Summary: <p>Text-conditioned image generation models are a prevalent use of AI image
synthesis, yet intuitively controlling output guided by an artist remains
challenging. Current methods require multiple images and textual prompts for
each object to specify them as concepts to generate a single customized image.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, our work, \verb|DiffMorph|, introduces a novel approach
that synthesizes images that mix concepts without the use of textual prompts.
Our work integrates a sketch-to-image module to incorporate user sketches as
input. \verb|DiffMorph| takes an initial image with conditioning artist-drawn
sketches to generate a morphed image.
</p>
<p>We employ a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model and fine-tune it to
reconstruct each image faithfully. We seamlessly merge images and concepts from
sketches into a cohesive composition. The image generation capability of our
work is demonstrated through our results and a comparison of these with

<li>Summary: <p>Recent work on object-centric world models aim to factorize representations
in terms of objects in a completely unsupervised or self-supervised manner.
Such world models are hypothesized to be a key component to address the
generalization problem. While self-supervision has shown improved performance
however, OOD generalization has not been systematically and explicitly tested.
In this paper, we conduct an extensive study on the generalization properties
of contrastive world model. We systematically test the model under a number of
different OOD generalization scenarios such as extrapolation to new object
attributes, introducing new conjunctions or new attributes. Our experiments
show that the contrastive world model fails to generalize under the different
OOD tests and the drop in performance depends on the extent to which the
samples are OOD. When visualizing the transition updates and convolutional
feature maps, we observe that any changes in object attributes (such as
previously unseen colors, shapes, or conjunctions of color and shape) breaks
down the factorization of object representations. Overall, our work highlights
the importance of object-centric representations for generalization and current
models are limited in their capacity to learn such representations required for
human-level generalization.

<li>Summary: <p>The extensive adoption of Self-supervised learning (SSL) has led to an
increased security threat from backdoor attacks. While existing research has
mainly focused on backdoor attacks in image classification, there has been
limited exploration into their implications for object detection. In this work,
we propose the first backdoor attack designed for object detection tasks in SSL
scenarios, termed Object Transform Attack (SSL-OTA). SSL-OTA employs a trigger
capable of altering predictions of the target object to the desired category,
encompassing two attacks: Data Poisoning Attack (NA) and Dual-Source Blending
Attack (DSBA). NA conducts data poisoning during downstream fine-tuning of the
object detector, while DSBA additionally injects backdoors into the pre-trained
encoder. We establish appropriate metrics and conduct extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness and utility of our proposed
attack. Notably, both NA and DSBA achieve high attack success rates (ASR) at
extremely low poisoning rates (0.5%). The results underscore the importance of
considering backdoor threats in SSL-based object detection and contribute a
novel perspective to the field.

<li>Summary: <p>Masked Image Modeling (MIM) arises as a promising option for Vision
Transformers among various self-supervised learning (SSL) methods. The essence
of MIM lies in token-wise masked patch predictions, with targets patchified
from images; or generated by pre-trained tokenizers or models. We argue targets
from the pre-trained models usually exhibit spatial inconsistency, which makes
it excessively challenging for the model to follow to learn more discriminative
representations. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a novel self-supervision
signal based on Dynamic Token Morphing (DTM), which dynamically aggregates
contextually related tokens. DTM can be generally applied to various SSL
frameworks, yet we propose a simple MIM that employs DTM to effectively improve
the performance barely introducing extra training costs. Our experiments on
ImageNet-1K and ADE20K evidently demonstrate the superiority of our methods.
Furthermore, the comparative evaluation of iNaturalist and Fine-grained Visual
Classification datasets further validates the transferability of our method on
various downstream tasks. Our code will be released publicly.

<li>Summary: <p>Video-based facial affect analysis has recently attracted increasing
attention owing to its critical role in human-computer interaction. Previous
studies mainly focus on developing various deep learning architectures and
training them in a fully supervised manner. Although significant progress has
been achieved by these supervised methods, the longstanding lack of large-scale
high-quality labeled data severely hinders their further improvements.
Motivated by the recent success of self-supervised learning in computer vision,
this paper introduces a self-supervised approach, termed Self-supervised Video
Facial Affect Perceiver (SVFAP), to address the dilemma faced by supervised
methods. Specifically, SVFAP leverages masked facial video autoencoding to
perform self-supervised pre-training on massive unlabeled facial videos.
Considering that large spatiotemporal redundancy exists in facial videos, we
propose a novel temporal pyramid and spatial bottleneck Transformer as the
encoder of SVFAP, which not only enjoys low computational cost but also
achieves excellent performance. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we
conduct experiments on nine datasets spanning three downstream tasks, including
dynamic facial expression recognition, dimensional emotion recognition, and
personality recognition. Comprehensive results demonstrate that SVFAP can learn
powerful affect-related representations via large-scale self-supervised
pre-training and it significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods
on all datasets. Codes will be available at https://github.com/sunlicai/SVFAP.

of particular interest to many applications such as autonomous cars, robotics

self-supervised method that comes in the middle of the standard pipeline and
generated refined representations of the original feature vectors. Experiments
show that this method improves the performance of existing models on different
sub-tasks of action segmentation, even without additional hyper parameter

<li>Summary: <p>In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of various self-supervised
Vision Transformers (ViTs), focusing on their local representative power.
Inspired by large language models, we examine the abilities of ViTs to perform
various computer vision tasks with little to no fine-tuning. We design an
evaluation framework to analyze the quality of local, i.e. patch-level,
representations in the context of few-shot semantic segmentation, instance
identification, object retrieval, and tracking. We discover that contrastive
learning based methods like DINO produce more universal patch representations
that can be immediately applied for downstream tasks with no parameter tuning,
compared to masked image modeling. The embeddings learned using the latter
approach, e.g. in masked autoencoders, have high variance features that harm
distance-based algorithms, such as k-NN, and do not contain useful information
for most downstream tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that removing these
high-variance features enhances k-NN by providing an analysis of the benchmarks
for this work and for Scale-MAE, a recent extension of masked autoencoders.
Finally, we find an object instance retrieval setting where DINOv2, a model
pretrained on two orders of magnitude more data, performs worse than its less
compute-intensive counterpart DINO.

<li>Summary: <p>It is challenging but highly desired to acquire high-quality photos with
clear content in low-light environments. Although multi-image processing
methods (using burst, dual-exposure, or multi-exposure images) have made
significant progress in addressing this issue, they typically focus exclusively
on specific restoration or enhancement tasks, being insufficient in exploiting
multi-image. Motivated by that multi-exposure images are complementary in
denoising, deblurring, high dynamic range imaging, and super-resolution, we
propose to utilize bracketing photography to unify restoration and enhancement
tasks in this work. Due to the difficulty in collecting real-world pairs, we
suggest a solution that first pre-trains the model with synthetic paired data
and then adapts it to real-world unlabeled images. In particular, a temporally
modulated recurrent network (TMRNet) and self-supervised adaptation method are
proposed. Moreover, we construct a data simulation pipeline to synthesize pairs
and collect real-world images from 200 nighttime scenarios. Experiments on both
datasets show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art
multi-image processing ones. The dataset, code, and pre-trained models are

<li>Summary: <p>Given the difficulty of manually annotating motion in video, the current best
motion estimation methods are trained with synthetic data, and therefore
struggle somewhat due to a train/test gap. Self-supervised methods hold the
promise of training directly on real video, but typically perform worse. These
include methods trained with warp error (i.e., color constancy) combined with
smoothness terms, and methods that encourage cycle-consistency in the estimates
(i.e., tracking backwards should yield the opposite trajectory as tracking
forwards). In this work, we take on the challenge of improving state-of-the-art
supervised models with self-supervised training. We find that when the
initialization is supervised weights, most existing self-supervision techniques
actually make performance worse instead of better, which suggests that the
benefit of seeing the new data is overshadowed by the noise in the training
signal. Focusing on obtaining a ``clean'' training signal from real-world
unlabelled video, we propose to separate label-making and training into two
distinct stages. In the first stage, we use the pre-trained model to estimate
motion in a video, and then select the subset of motion estimates which we can
verify with cycle-consistency. This produces a sparse but accurate
pseudo-labelling of the video. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model to
reproduce these outputs, while also applying augmentations on the input. We
complement this boot-strapping method with simple techniques that densify and
re-balance the pseudo-labels, ensuring that we do not merely train on ``easy''
tracks. We show that our method yields reliable gains over fully-supervised
methods in real videos, for both short-term (flow-based) and long-range
(multi-frame) pixel tracking.

<li>Summary: <p>Decision-making is a dynamic process requiring perception, memory, and
reasoning to make choices and find optimal policies. Traditional approaches to
decision-making suffer from sample efficiency and generalization, while
large-scale self-supervised pretraining has enabled fast adaptation with

pretraining into downstream decision-making problems. We propose
Pretrain-Then-Adapt pipeline and survey recent work on data collection,
pretraining objectives and adaptation strategies for decision-making
pretraining and downstream inference. Finally, we identify critical challenges
and future directions for developing decision foundation model with the help of

<li>Summary: <p>Deceptive images can be shared in seconds with social networking services,
posing substantial risks. Tampering traces, such as boundary artifacts and
high-frequency information, have been significantly emphasized by massive
networks in the Image Manipulation Localization (IML) field. However, they are
prone to image post-processing operations, which limit the generalization and
robustness of existing methods. We present a novel Prompt-IML framework. We
observe that humans tend to discern the authenticity of an image based on both
semantic and high-frequency information, inspired by which, the proposed
framework leverages rich semantic knowledge from pre-trained visual foundation
models to assist IML. We are the first to design a framework that utilizes
visual foundation models specially for the IML task. Moreover, we design a
Feature Alignment and Fusion module to align and fuse features of semantic
features with high-frequency features, which aims at locating tampered regions
from multiple perspectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can
achieve better performance on eight typical fake image datasets and outstanding
robustness.

<li>Summary: <p>We introduce a novel generative model, the Discrete Distribution Networks
(DDN), that approximates data distribution using hierarchical discrete
distributions. We posit that since the features within a network inherently
contain distributional information, liberating the network from a single output
to concurrently generate multiple samples proves to be highly effective.
Therefore, DDN fits the target distribution, including continuous ones, by
generating multiple discrete sample points. To capture finer details of the
target data, DDN selects the output that is closest to the Ground Truth (GT)
from the coarse results generated in the first layer. This selected output is
then fed back into the network as a condition for the second layer, thereby
generating new outputs more similar to the GT. As the number of DDN layers
increases, the representational space of the outputs expands exponentially, and
the generated samples become increasingly similar to the GT. This hierarchical
output pattern of discrete distributions endows DDN with two intriguing
properties: highly compressed representation and more general zero-shot
conditional generation. We demonstrate the efficacy of DDN and these intriguing
properties through experiments on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ.

<li>Summary: <p>Recent image restoration methods can be broadly categorized into two classes:
(1) regression methods that recover the rough structure of the original image
without synthesizing high-frequency details and (2) generative methods that
synthesize perceptually-realistic high-frequency details even though the
resulting image deviates from the original structure of the input. While both
directions have been extensively studied in isolation, merging their benefits
with a single framework has been rarely studied. In this paper, we propose
UGPNet, a universal image restoration framework that can effectively achieve
the benefits of both approaches by simply adopting a pair of an existing
regression model and a generative model. UGPNet first restores the image
structure of a degraded input using a regression model and synthesizes a
perceptually-realistic image with a generative model on top of the regressed
output. UGPNet then combines the regressed output and the synthesized output,
resulting in a final result that faithfully reconstructs the structure of the
original image in addition to perceptually-realistic textures. Our extensive
experiments on deblurring, denoising, and super-resolution demonstrate that
UGPNet can successfully exploit both regression and generative methods for
high-fidelity image restoration.

<li>Summary: <p>Recent advancements in cognitive computing, with the integration of deep
learning techniques, have facilitated the development of intelligent cognitive
systems (ICS). This is particularly beneficial in the context of rail defect
detection, where the ICS would emulate human-like analysis of image data for
defect patterns. Despite the success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in
visual defect classification, the scarcity of large datasets for rail defect
detection remains a challenge due to infrequent accident events that would
result in defective parts and images. Contemporary researchers have addressed
this data scarcity challenge by exploring rule-based and generative data
augmentation models. Among these, Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models can
generate realistic data without extensive baseline datasets for noise modeling.
This study proposes a VAE-based synthetic image generation technique for rail
defects, incorporating weight decay regularization and image reconstruction
loss to prevent overfitting. The proposed method is applied to create a
synthetic dataset for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) with just 50 real
samples across five classes. Remarkably, 500 synthetic samples are generated
with a minimal reconstruction loss of 0.021. A Visual Transformer (ViT) model
underwent fine-tuning using this synthetic CPR dataset, achieving high accuracy
rates (98%-99%) in classifying the five defect classes. This research offers a
promising solution to the data scarcity challenge in rail defect detection,
showcasing the potential for robust ICS development in this domain.

<li>Summary: <p>In contrast to the well-investigated field of SAR-to-Optical translation,
this study explores the lesser-investigated domain of Optical-to-SAR
translation, a challenging field due to the ill-posed nature of this
translation. The complexity arises as a single optical data can have multiple
SAR representations based on the SAR viewing geometry. We propose a novel
approach, termed SAR Temporal Shifting, which inputs an optical data from the
desired timestamp along with a SAR data from a different temporal point but
with a consistent viewing geometry as the expected SAR data, both complemented
with a change map of optical data during the intervening period. This model
modifies the SAR data based on the changes observed in optical data to generate
the SAR data for the desired timestamp. Our model, a dual conditional
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), named Temporal Shifting GAN (TSGAN),
incorporates a siamese encoder in both the Generator and the Discriminator. To
prevent the model from overfitting on the input SAR data, we employed a change
weighted loss function. Our approach surpasses traditional translation methods
by eliminating the GAN's fiction phenomenon, particularly in unchanged regions,
resulting in higher SSIM and PSNR in these areas. Additionally, modifications
to the Pix2Pix architecture and the inclusion of attention mechanisms have
enhanced the model's performance on all regions of the data. This research
paves the way for leveraging legacy optical datasets, the most abundant and
longstanding source of Earth datary data, extending their use to SAR domains
and temporal analyses. To foster further research, we provide the code,
datasets used in our study, and a framework for generating paired SAR-Optical
datasets for new regions of interest. These resources are available on

display a certain level of security and embedding capacity, they lack adequate
robustness against common distortions in online social networks (OSNs). In this
paper, we introduce an end-to-end robust generative video steganography network
(RoGVS), which achieves visual editing by modifying semantic feature of videos
to embed secret message. We employ face-swapping scenario to showcase the
visual editing effects. We first design a secret message embedding module to
adaptively hide secret message into the semantic feature of videos. Extensive
experiments display that the proposed RoGVS method applied to facial video
datasets demonstrate its superiority over existing video and image
steganography techniques in terms of both robustness and capacity.

Recent research has sought to integrate natural language processing (NLP) and
generative artificial intelligence (AI) into human settlement construction
tasks. Due to the efficient processing and analysis capabilities of AI with
data, significant successes have been achieved in design within this domain.
However, this task still faces several fundamental challenges. The semantic
information involved includes complex spatial details, diverse data source
formats, high sensitivity to regional culture, and demanding requirements for
innovation and rigor in work scenarios. These factors lead to limitations when
applying general generative AI in this field, further exacerbated by a lack of
high-quality data for model training. To address these challenges, this paper
first proposes HSC-GPT, a large-scale language model framework specifically

<li>Summary: <p>Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover concise closed-form mathematical
equations from data, a task fundamental to scientific discovery. However, the
problem is highly challenging because closed-form equations lie in a complex
combinatorial search space. Existing methods, ranging from heuristic search to
reinforcement learning, fail to scale with the number of input variables. We
make the observation that closed-form equations often have structural
characteristics and invariances (e.g., the commutative law) that could be
further exploited to build more effective symbolic regression solutions.
Motivated by this observation, our key contribution is to leverage pre-trained
deep generative models to capture the intrinsic regularities of equations,
thereby providing a solid foundation for subsequent optimization steps. We show
that our novel formalism unifies several prominent approaches of symbolic
regression and offers a new perspective to justify and improve on the previous
ad hoc designs, such as the usage of cross-entropy loss during pre-training.
Specifically, we propose an instantiation of our framework, Deep Generative
Symbolic Regression (DGSR). In our experiments, we show that DGSR achieves a
higher recovery rate of true equations in the setting of a larger number of
input variables, and it is more computationally efficient at inference time
than state-of-the-art RL symbolic regression solutions.

<li>Summary: <p>The integration of sensorized vessels, enabling real-time data collection and

This study presents a deep learning-driven anomaly detection system augmented
with interpretable machine learning models for identifying performance
anomalies in an industrial sensorized vessel, called TUCANA. We Leverage a
human-in-the-loop unsupervised process that involves utilizing standard and
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoders augmented with interpretable
surrogate models, i.e., random forest and decision tree, to add transparency
and interpretability to the results provided by the deep learning models. The
interpretable models also enable automated rule generation for translating the
inference into human-readable rules. Additionally, the process also includes
providing a projection of the results using t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding (t-SNE), which helps with a better understanding of the structure and
relationships within the data and assessment of the identified anomalies. We
empirically evaluate the system using real data acquired from the vessel TUCANA
and the results involve achieving over 80% precision and 90% recall with the

language processing applications, their safety concerns become critical areas
of NLP research. This paper presents Safety and Over-Defensiveness Evaluation
(SODE) benchmark: a collection of diverse safe and unsafe prompts with
carefully designed evaluation methods that facilitate systematic evaluation,
comparison, and analysis over 'safety' and 'over-defensiveness.' With SODE, we
study a variety of LLM defense strategies over multiple state-of-the-art LLMs,
which reveals several interesting and important findings, such as (a) the
widely popular 'self-checking' techniques indeed improve the safety against
unsafe inputs, but this comes at the cost of extreme over-defensiveness on the
safe inputs, (b) providing a safety instruction along with in-context exemplars
(of both safe and unsafe inputs) consistently improves safety and also
mitigates undue over-defensiveness of the models, (c) providing contextual
knowledge easily breaks the safety guardrails and makes the models more
vulnerable to generating unsafe responses. Overall, our work reveals numerous
such critical findings that we believe will pave the way and facilitate further
research in improving the safety of LLMs.

<li>Summary: <p>The emergence of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) has greatly
increased interest in utilizing LLMs as therapists to support individuals
struggling with mental health challenges. However, due to the lack of
systematic studies, our understanding of how LLM therapists behave, i.e., ways
in which they respond to clients, is significantly limited. Understanding their
behavior across a wide range of clients and situations is crucial to accurately
assess their capabilities and limitations in the high-risk setting of mental
health, where undesirable behaviors can lead to severe consequences. In this
paper, we propose BOLT, a novel computational framework to study the
conversational behavior of LLMs when employed as therapists. We develop an
in-context learning method to quantitatively measure the behavior of LLMs based
on 13 different psychotherapy techniques including reflections, questions,
solutions, normalizing, and psychoeducation. Subsequently, we compare the
behavior of LLM therapists against that of high- and low-quality human therapy,
and study how their behavior can be modulated to better reflect behaviors
observed in high-quality therapy. Our analysis of GPT and Llama-variants
reveals that these LLMs often resemble behaviors more commonly exhibited in
low-quality therapy rather than high-quality therapy, such as offering a higher
degree of problem-solving advice when clients share emotions, which is against
typical recommendations. At the same time, unlike low-quality therapy, LLMs
reflect significantly more upon clients' needs and strengths. Our analysis
framework suggests that despite the ability of LLMs to generate anecdotal
examples that appear similar to human therapists, LLM therapists are currently
not fully consistent with high-quality care, and thus require additional
research to ensure quality care.
