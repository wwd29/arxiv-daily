<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Adversarial Training is a proven defense strategy against adversarial malware. However, generating adversarial malware samples for this type of training presents a challenge because the resulting adversarial malware needs to remain evasive and functional. This work proposes an attack framework, EGAN, to address this limitation. EGAN leverages an Evolution Strategy and Generative Adversarial Network to select a sequence of attack actions that can mutate a Ransomware file while preserving its original functionality. We tested this framework on popular AI-powered commercial antivirus systems listed on VirusTotal and demonstrated that our framework is capable of bypassing the majority of these systems. Moreover, we evaluated whether the EGAN attack framework can evade other commercial non-AI antivirus solutions. Our results indicate that the adversarial ransomware generated can increase the probability of evading some of them.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The presence of interference, where the outcome of an individual may depend on the treatment assignment and behavior of neighboring nodes, can lead to biased causal effect estimation. Current approaches to network experiment design focus on limiting interference through cluster-based randomization, in which clusters are identified using graph clustering, and cluster randomization dictates the node assignment to treatment and control. However, cluster-based randomization approaches perform poorly when interference propagates in cascades, whereby the response of individuals to treatment propagates to their multi-hop neighbors. When we have knowledge of the cascade seed nodes, we can leverage this interference structure to mitigate the resulting causal effect estimation bias. With this goal, we propose a cascade-based network experiment design that initiates treatment assignment from the cascade seed node and propagates the assignment to their multi-hop neighbors to limit interference during cascade growth and thereby reduce the overall causal effect estimation error. Our extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches in estimating causal effects in network data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>World models constitute a promising approach for training reinforcement learning agents in a safe and sample-efficient manner. Recent world models predominantly operate on sequences of discrete latent variables to model environment dynamics. However, this compression into a compact discrete representation may ignore visual details that are important for reinforcement learning. Concurrently, diffusion models have become a dominant approach for image generation, challenging well-established methods modeling discrete latents. Motivated by this paradigm shift, we introduce DIAMOND (DIffusion As a Model Of eNvironment Dreams), a reinforcement learning agent trained in a diffusion world model. We analyze the key design choices that are required to make diffusion suitable for world modeling, and demonstrate how improved visual details can lead to improved agent performance. DIAMOND achieves a mean human normalized score of 1.46 on the competitive Atari 100k benchmark; a new best for agents trained entirely within a world model. To foster future research on diffusion for world modeling, we release our code, agents and playable world models at this https URL.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We introduce a pioneering approach to self-supervised learning for point clouds, employing a geometrically informed mask selection strategy called GeoMask3D (GM3D) to boost the efficiency of Masked Auto Encoders (MAE). Unlike the conventional method of random masking, our technique utilizes a teacher-student model to focus on intricate areas within the data, guiding the model's focus toward regions with higher geometric complexity. This strategy is grounded in the hypothesis that concentrating on harder patches yields a more robust feature representation, as evidenced by the improved performance on downstream tasks. Our method also presents a complete-to-partial feature-level knowledge distillation technique designed to guide the prediction of geometric complexity utilizing a comprehensive context from feature-level information. Extensive experiments confirm our method's superiority over State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) baselines, demonstrating marked improvements in classification, and few-shot tasks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traditional 3D garment creation is labor-intensive, involving sketching, modeling, UV mapping, and texturing, which are time-consuming and costly. Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have enabled new possibilities for 3D garment generation from text prompts, images, and videos. However, existing methods either suffer from inconsistencies among multi-view images or require additional processes to separate cloth from the underlying human model. In this paper, we propose GarmentDreamer, a novel method that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as guidance to generate wearable, simulation-ready 3D garment meshes from text prompts. In contrast to using multi-view images directly predicted by generative models as guidance, our 3DGS guidance ensures consistent optimization in both garment deformation and texture synthesis. Our method introduces a novel garment augmentation module, guided by normal and RGBA information, and employs implicit Neural Texture Fields (NeTF) combined with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to generate diverse geometric and texture details. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, showcasing the superior performance of GarmentDreamer over state-of-the-art alternatives.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Existing solutions to image editing tasks suffer from several issues. Though achieving remarkably satisfying generated results, some supervised methods require huge amounts of paired training data, which greatly limits their usages. The other unsupervised methods take full advantage of large-scale pre-trained priors, thus being strictly restricted to the domains where the priors are trained on and behaving badly in out-of-distribution cases. The task we focus on is how to enable the users to customize their desired effects through only few image pairs. In our proposed framework, a novel few-shot learning mechanism based on the directional transformations among samples is introduced and expands the learnable space exponentially. Adopting a diffusion model pipeline, we redesign the condition calculating modules in our model and apply several technical improvements. Experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of our method in various cases.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Optical flow estimation is one of the fundamental tasks in low-level computer vision, which describes the pixel-wise displacement and can be used in many other tasks. From the apparent aspect, the optical flow can be viewed as the correlation between the pixels in consecutive frames, so continuously refining the correlation volume can achieve an outstanding performance. However, it will make the method have a catastrophic computational complexity. Not only that, the error caused by the occlusion regions of the successive frames will be amplified through the inaccurate warp operation. These challenges can not be solved only from the apparent view, so this paper rethinks the optical flow estimation from the kinetics viewpoint.We propose a method combining the apparent and kinetics information from this motivation. The proposed method directly predicts the optical flow from the feature extracted from images instead of building the correlation volume, which will improve the efficiency of the whole network. Meanwhile, the proposed method involves a new differentiable warp operation that simultaneously considers the warping and occlusion. Moreover, the proposed method blends the kinetics feature with the apparent feature through the novel self-supervised loss function. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments and ablation studies prove that the proposed novel insight into how to predict the optical flow can achieve the better performance of the state-of-the-art methods, and in some metrics, the proposed method outperforms the correlation-based method, especially in situations containing occlusion and fast moving. The code will be public.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are deep-learning architectures designed for graph-type data, where understanding relationships among individual observations is crucial. However, achieving promising GNN performance, especially on unseen data, requires comprehensive hyperparameter tuning and meticulous training. Unfortunately, these processes come with high computational costs and significant human effort. Additionally, conventional searching algorithms such as grid search may result in overfitting on validation data, diminishing generalization accuracy. To tackle these challenges, we propose a graph conditional latent diffusion framework (GNN-Diff) to generate high-performing GNNs directly by learning from checkpoints saved during a light-tuning coarse search. Our method: (1) unleashes GNN training from heavy tuning and complex search space design; (2) produces GNN parameters that outperform those obtained through comprehensive grid search; and (3) establishes higher-quality generation for GNNs compared to diffusion frameworks designed for general neural networks.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Textual image generation spans diverse fields like advertising, education, product packaging, social media, information visualization, and branding. Despite recent strides in language-guided image synthesis using diffusion models, current models excel in image generation but struggle with accurate text rendering and offer limited control over font attributes. In this paper, we aim to enhance the synthesis of high-quality images with precise text customization, thereby contributing to the advancement of image generation models. We call our proposed method CustomText. Our implementation leverages a pre-trained TextDiffuser model to enable control over font color, background, and types. Additionally, to address the challenge of accurately rendering small-sized fonts, we train the ControlNet model for a consistency decoder, significantly enhancing text-generation performance. We assess the performance of CustomText in comparison to previous methods of textual image generation on the publicly available CTW-1500 dataset and a self-curated dataset for small-text generation, showcasing superior results.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>For visual content generation, discrepancies between user intentions and the generated content have been a longstanding problem. This discrepancy arises from two main factors. First, user intentions are inherently complex, with subtle details not fully captured by input prompts. The absence of such details makes it challenging for generative models to accurately reflect the intended meaning, leading to a mismatch between the desired and generated output. Second, generative models trained on visual-label pairs lack the comprehensive knowledge to accurately represent all aspects of the input data in their generated outputs. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge-enhanced iterative refinement framework for visual content generation. We begin by analyzing and identifying the key challenges faced by existing generative models. Then, we introduce various knowledge sources, including human insights, pre-trained models, logic rules, and world knowledge, which can be leveraged to address these challenges. Furthermore, we propose a novel visual generation framework that incorporates a knowledge-based feedback module to iteratively refine the generation process. This module gradually improves the alignment between the generated content and user intentions. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework through preliminary results, highlighting the potential of knowledge-enhanced generative models for intention-aligned content generation.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Fact-checking based on commercial LLMs has become mainstream. Although these methods offer high explainability, it falls short in accuracy compared to traditional fine-tuning approaches, and data security is also a significant concern. In this paper, we propose a self-instruction based fine-tuning approach for fact-checking that balances accuracy and explainability. Our method consists of Data Augmentation and Improved DPO fine-tuning. The former starts by instructing the model to generate both positive and negative explanations based on claim-evidence pairs and labels, then sampling the dataset according to our customized difficulty standards. The latter employs our proposed improved DPO to fine-tune the model using the generated samples. We fine-tune the smallest-scale LLaMA-7B model and evaluate it on the challenging fact-checking datasets FEVEROUS and HOVER, utilizing four fine-tuning methods and three few-shot learning methods for comparison. The experiments demonstrate that our approach not only retains accuracy comparable to, or even surpassing, traditional fine-tuning methods, but also generates fluent explanation text. Moreover, it also exhibit high generalization performance. Our method is the first to leverage self-supervised learning for fact-checking and innovatively combines contrastive learning and improved DPO in fine-tuning LLMs, as shown in the experiments.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the proliferation of red-teaming strategies for Large Language Models (LLMs), the deficiency in the literature about improving the safety and robustness of LLM defense strategies is becoming increasingly pronounced. This paper introduces the LLM-based \textbf{sentinel} model as a plug-and-play prefix module designed to reconstruct the input prompt with just a few ($<30$) additional tokens, effectively reducing toxicity in responses from target LLMs. The sentinel model naturally overcomes the \textit{parameter inefficiency} and \textit{limited model accessibility} for fine-tuning large target models. We employ an interleaved training regimen using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize both red team and sentinel models dynamically, incorporating a value head-sharing mechanism inspired by the multi-agent centralized critic to manage the complex interplay between agents. Our extensive experiments across text-to-text and text-to-image demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating toxic outputs, even when dealing with larger models like \texttt{Llama-2}, \texttt{GPT-3.5} and \texttt{Stable-Diffusion}, highlighting the potential of our framework in enhancing safety and robustness in various applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>in-context</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Emergence, broadly conceptualized as the ``intelligent'' behaviors of LLMs, has recently been studied and proved challenging to quantify due to the lack of a measurable definition. Most commonly, it has been estimated statistically through model performances across extensive datasets and tasks, which consumes significant resources. In addition, such estimation is difficult to interpret and may not accurately reflect the models' intrinsic emergence. In this work, we propose a quantifiable solution for estimating emergence. Inspired by emergentism in dynamics, we quantify the strength of emergence by comparing the entropy reduction of the macroscopic (semantic) level with that of the microscopic (token) level, both of which are derived from the representations within the transformer block. Using a low-cost estimator, our quantification method demonstrates consistent behaviors across a suite of LMs (GPT-2, GEMMA, etc.) under both in-context learning (ICL) and natural sentences. Empirical results show that (1) our method gives consistent measurements which align with existing observations based on performance metrics, validating the effectiveness of our emergence quantification; (2) our proposed metric uncovers novel emergence patterns such as the correlations between the variance of our metric and the number of ``shots'' in ICL, which further suggests a new way of interpreting hallucinations in LLMs; (3) we offer a potential solution towards estimating the emergence of larger and closed-resource LMs via smaller LMs like GPT-2.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Affective Image Manipulation (AIM) seeks to modify user-provided images to evoke specific emotional responses. This task is inherently complex due to its twofold objective: significantly evoking the intended emotion, while preserving the original image composition. Existing AIM methods primarily adjust color and style, often failing to elicit precise and profound emotional shifts. Drawing on psychological insights, we extend AIM by incorporating content modifications to enhance emotional impact. We introduce EmoEdit, a novel two-stage framework comprising emotion attribution and image editing. In the emotion attribution stage, we leverage a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to create hierarchies of semantic factors that represent abstract emotions. In the image editing stage, the VLM identifies the most relevant factors for the provided image, and guides a generative editing model to perform affective modifications. A ranking technique that we developed selects the best edit, balancing between emotion fidelity and structure integrity. To validate EmoEdit, we assembled a dataset of 416 images, categorized into positive, negative, and neutral classes. Our method is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we showcase EmoEdit's potential in various manipulation tasks, including emotion-oriented and semantics-oriented editing.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>This work addresses the need for a balanced approach between performance and efficiency in scalable production environments for visually-rich document understanding (VDU) tasks. Currently, there is a reliance on large document foundation models that offer advanced capabilities but come with a heavy computational burden. In this paper, we propose a multimodal early exit (EE) model design that incorporates various training strategies, exit layer types and placements. Our goal is to achieve a Pareto-optimal balance between predictive performance and efficiency for multimodal document image classification. Through a comprehensive set of experiments, we compare our approach with traditional exit policies and showcase an improved performance-efficiency trade-off. Our multimodal EE design preserves the model's predictive capabilities, enhancing both speed and latency. This is achieved through a reduction of over 20% in latency, while fully retaining the baseline accuracy. This research represents the first exploration of multimodal EE design within the VDU community, highlighting as well the effectiveness of calibration in improving confidence scores for exiting at different layers. Overall, our findings contribute to practical VDU applications by enhancing both performance and efficiency.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this article, we propose the detection of crowd anomalies through the extraction of information in the form of time series from video format using a multimodal approach. Through pattern recognition algorithms and segmentation, informative measures of the number of people and image occupancy are extracted at regular intervals, which are then analyzed to obtain trends and anomalous behaviors. Specifically, through temporal decomposition and residual analysis, intervals or specific situations of unusual behaviors are identified, which can be used in decision-making and improvement of actions in sectors related to human movement such as tourism or security. The application of this methodology on the webcam of Turisme Comunitat Valenciana in the town of Morella (Comunitat Valenciana, Spain) has provided excellent results. It is shown to correctly detect specific anomalous situations and unusual overall increases during the previous weekend and during the festivities in October 2023. These results have been obtained while preserving the confidentiality of individuals at all times by using measures that maximize anonymity, without trajectory recording or person recognition.</li>

Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of 42 LLM models in cybersecurity knowledge and hardware security, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. We thoroughly evaluate cybersecurity datasets for LLM training and testing, covering the lifecycle from data creation to usage and identifying gaps for future research. In addition, we review new strategies for leveraging LLMs, including techniques like Half-Quadratic Quantization (HQQ), Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Quantized Low-Rank Adapters (QLoRA), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These insights aim to enhance real-time cybersecurity defenses and improve the sophistication of LLM applications in threat detection and response. Our paper provides a foundational understanding and strategic direction for integrating LLMs into future cybersecurity frameworks, emphasizing innovation and robust model deployment to safeguard against evolving cyber threats.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Vision-Language Instruction Tuning (VLIT) is a critical training phase for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). With the improving capabilities of open-source LVLMs, researchers have increasingly turned to generate VLIT data by using open-source LVLMs and achieved significant progress. However, such data generation approaches are bottlenecked by the following challenges: 1) Since multi-modal models tend to be influenced by prior language knowledge, directly using LVLMs to generate VLIT data would inevitably lead to low content relevance between generated data and images. 2) To improve the ability of the models to generate VLIT data, previous methods have incorporated an additional training phase to boost the generative capacity. This process hurts the generalization of the models to unseen inputs (i.e., "exposure bias" problem). In this paper, we propose a new Content Correlated VLIT data generation via Contrastive Learning (C3L). Specifically, we design a new content relevance module which enhances the content relevance between VLIT data and images by computing Image Instruction Correspondence Scores S(I2C). Moreover, a contrastive learning module is introduced to further boost the VLIT data generation capability of the LVLMs. A large number of automatic measures on four benchmarks show the effectiveness of our method.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>self-supervised</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Unsupervised pre-training has emerged as a transformative paradigm, displaying remarkable advancements in various domains. However, the susceptibility to domain shift, where pre-training data distribution differs from fine-tuning, poses a significant obstacle. To address this, we augment the Swin Transformer to learn from different medical imaging modalities, enhancing downstream performance. Our model, dubbed SwinFUSE (Swin Multi-Modal Fusion for UnSupervised Enhancement), offers three key advantages: (i) it learns from both Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) during pre-training, resulting in complementary feature representations; (ii) a domain-invariance module (DIM) that effectively highlights salient input regions, enhancing adaptability; (iii) exhibits remarkable generalizability, surpassing the confines of tasks it was initially pre-trained on. Our experiments on two publicly available 3D segmentation datasets show a modest 1-2% performance trade-off compared to single-modality models, yet significant out-performance of up to 27% on out-of-distribution modality. This substantial improvement underscores our proposed approach's practical relevance and real-world applicability. Code is available at: this https URL</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Inpainting lesions within different normal backgrounds is a potential method of addressing the generalization problem, which is crucial for polyp segmentation models. However, seamlessly introducing polyps into complex endoscopic environments while simultaneously generating accurate pseudo-masks remains a challenge for current inpainting methods. To address these issues, we first leverage the pre-trained Stable Diffusion Inpaint and ControlNet, to introduce a robust generative model capable of inpainting polyps across different backgrounds. Secondly, we utilize the prior that synthetic polyps are confined to the inpainted region, to establish an inpainted region-guided pseudo-mask refinement network. We also propose a sample selection strategy that prioritizes well-aligned and hard synthetic cases for further model fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our inpainting model outperformed baseline methods both qualitatively and quantitatively in inpainting quality. Moreover, our data augmentation strategy significantly enhances the performance of polyp segmentation models on external datasets, achieving or surpassing the level of fully supervised training benchmarks in that domain.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Generating customized content in videos has received increasing attention recently. However, existing works primarily focus on customized text-to-video generation for single subject, suffering from subject-missing and attribute-binding problems when the video is expected to contain multiple subjects. Furthermore, existing models struggle to assign the desired actions to the corresponding subjects (action-binding problem), failing to achieve satisfactory multi-subject generation performance. To tackle the problems, in this paper, we propose DisenStudio, a novel framework that can generate text-guided videos for customized multiple subjects, given few images for each subject. Specifically, DisenStudio enhances a pretrained diffusion-based text-to-video model with our proposed spatial-disentangled cross-attention mechanism to associate each subject with the desired action. Then the model is customized for the multiple subjects with the proposed motion-preserved disentangled finetuning, which involves three tuning strategies: multi-subject co-occurrence tuning, masked single-subject tuning, and multi-subject motion-preserved tuning. The first two strategies guarantee the subject occurrence and preserve their visual attributes, and the third strategy helps the model maintain the temporal motion-generation ability when finetuning on static images. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate our proposed DisenStudio significantly outperforms existing methods in various metrics. Additionally, we show that DisenStudio can be used as a powerful tool for various controllable generation applications.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>diffusion, generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Remote sensing image change captioning (RSICC) aims at generating human-like language to describe the semantic changes between bi-temporal remote sensing image pairs. It provides valuable insights into environmental dynamics and land management. Unlike conventional change captioning task, RSICC involves not only retrieving relevant information across different modalities and generating fluent captions, but also mitigating the impact of pixel-level differences on terrain change localization. The pixel problem due to long time span decreases the accuracy of generated caption. Inspired by the remarkable generative power of diffusion model, we propose a probabilistic diffusion model for RSICC to solve the aforementioned problems. In training process, we construct a noise predictor conditioned on cross modal features to learn the distribution from the real caption distribution to the standard Gaussian distribution under the Markov chain. Meanwhile, a cross-mode fusion and a stacking self-attention module are designed for noise predictor in the reverse process. In testing phase, the well-trained noise predictor helps to estimate the mean value of the distribution and generate change captions step by step. Extensive experiments on the LEVIR-CC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our Diffusion-RSCC and its individual components. The quantitative results showcase superior performance over existing methods across both traditional and newly augmented metrics.

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Recent advancements in open-domain dialogue systems have been propelled by the emergence of high-quality large language models (LLMs) and various effective training methodologies. Nevertheless, the presence of toxicity within these models presents a significant challenge that can potentially diminish the user experience. In this study, we introduce an innovative training algorithm, an improvement upon direct preference optimization (DPO), called adversarial DPO (ADPO). The ADPO algorithm is designed to train models to assign higher probability distributions to preferred responses and lower distributions to unsafe responses, which are self-generated using the toxic control token. We demonstrate that ADPO enhances the model's resilience against harmful conversations while minimizing performance degradation. Furthermore, we illustrate that ADPO offers a more stable training procedure compared to the traditional DPO. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first adaptation of the DPO algorithm that directly incorporates harmful data into the generative model, thereby reducing the need to artificially create safe dialogue data.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>One critical prerequisite for faithful text-to-image generation is the accurate understanding of text inputs. Existing methods leverage the text encoder of the CLIP model to represent input prompts. However, the pre-trained CLIP model can merely encode English with a maximum token length of 77. Moreover, the model capacity of the text encoder from CLIP is relatively limited compared to Large Language Models (LLMs), which offer multilingual input, accommodate longer context, and achieve superior text representation. In this paper, we investigate LLMs as the text encoder to improve the language understanding in text-to-image generation. Unfortunately, training text-to-image generative model with LLMs from scratch demands significant computational resources and data. To this end, we introduce a three-stage training pipeline that effectively and efficiently integrates the existing text-to-image model with LLMs. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter that enables fast training of the text-to-image model using the textual representations from LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model supports not only multilingual but also longer input context with superior image generation quality.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Code-mixed discourse combines multiple languages in a single text. It is commonly used in informal discourse in countries with several official languages, but also in many other countries in combination with English or neighboring languages. As recently large language models have dominated most natural language processing tasks, we investigated their performance in code-mixed settings for relevant tasks. We first created four new bilingual pre-trained masked language models for English-Hindi and English-Slovene languages, specifically aimed to support informal language. Then we performed an evaluation of monolingual, bilingual, few-lingual, and massively multilingual models on several languages, using two tasks that frequently contain code-mixed text, in particular, sentiment analysis and offensive language detection in social media texts. The results show that the most successful classifiers are fine-tuned bilingual models and multilingual models, specialized for social media texts, followed by non-specialized massively multilingual and monolingual models, while huge generative models are not competitive. For our affective problems, the models mostly perform slightly better on code-mixed data compared to non-code-mixed data.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We provide faster randomized algorithms for computing an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in a discounted Markov decision process with $A_{\text{tot}}$-state-action pairs, bounded rewards, and discount factor $\gamma$. We provide an $\tilde{O}(A_{\text{tot}}[(1 - \gamma)^{-3}\epsilon^{-2} + (1 - \gamma)^{-2}])$-time algorithm in the sampling setting, where the probability transition matrix is unknown but accessible through a generative model which can be queried in $\tilde{O}(1)$-time, and an $\tilde{O}(s + (1-\gamma)^{-2})$-time algorithm in the offline setting where the probability transition matrix is known and $s$-sparse. These results improve upon the prior state-of-the-art which either ran in $\tilde{O}(A_{\text{tot}}[(1 - \gamma)^{-3}\epsilon^{-2} + (1 - \gamma)^{-3}])$ time [Sidford, Wang, Wu, Ye 2018] in the sampling setting, $\tilde{O}(s + A_{\text{tot}} (1-\gamma)^{-3})$ time [Sidford, Wang, Wu, Yang, Ye 2018] in the offline setting, or time at least quadratic in the number of states using interior point methods for linear programming. We achieve our results by building upon prior stochastic variance-reduced value iteration methods [Sidford, Wang, Wu, Yang, Ye 2018]. We provide a variant that carefully truncates the progress of its iterates to improve the variance of new variance-reduced sampling procedures that we introduce to implement the steps. Our method is essentially model-free and can be implemented in $\tilde{O}(A_{\text{tot}})$-space when given generative model access. Consequently, our results take a step in closing the sample-complexity gap between model-free and model-based methods.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>generative</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Noisy labels significantly hinder the accuracy and generalization of machine learning models, particularly due to ambiguous instance features. Traditional techniques that attempt to correct noisy labels directly, such as those using transition matrices, often fail to address the inherent complexities of the problem sufficiently. In this paper, we introduce EchoAlign, a transformative paradigm shift in learning from noisy labels. Instead of focusing on label correction, EchoAlign treats noisy labels ($\tilde{Y}$) as accurate and modifies corresponding instance features ($X$) to achieve better alignment with $\tilde{Y}$. EchoAlign's core components are (1) EchoMod: Employing controllable generative models, EchoMod precisely modifies instances while maintaining their intrinsic characteristics and ensuring alignment with the noisy labels. (2) EchoSelect: Instance modification inevitably introduces distribution shifts between training and test sets. EchoSelect maintains a significant portion of clean original instances to mitigate these shifts. It leverages the distinct feature similarity distributions between original and modified instances as a robust tool for accurate sample selection. This integrated approach yields remarkable results. In environments with 30% instance-dependent noise, even at 99% selection accuracy, EchoSelect retains nearly twice the number of samples compared to the previous best method. Notably, on three datasets, EchoAlign surpasses previous state-of-the-art techniques with a substantial improvement.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Current face reenactment and swapping methods mainly rely on GAN frameworks, but recent focus has shifted to pre-trained diffusion models for their superior generation capabilities. However, training these models is resource-intensive, and the results have not yet achieved satisfactory performance levels. To address this issue, we introduce Face-Adapter, an efficient and effective adapter designed for high-precision and high-fidelity face editing for pre-trained diffusion models. We observe that both face reenactment/swapping tasks essentially involve combinations of target structure, ID and attribute. We aim to sufficiently decouple the control of these factors to achieve both tasks in one model. Specifically, our method contains: 1) A Spatial Condition Generator that provides precise landmarks and background; 2) A Plug-and-play Identity Encoder that transfers face embeddings to the text space by a transformer decoder. 3) An Attribute Controller that integrates spatial conditions and detailed attributes. Face-Adapter achieves comparable or even superior performance in terms of motion control precision, ID retention capability, and generation quality compared to fully fine-tuned face reenactment/swapping models. Additionally, Face-Adapter seamlessly integrates with various StableDiffusion models.</li>

<li><strong>Keywords: </strong>foundation model</a></li>
<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Biomedical image analysis is fundamental for biomedical discovery in cell biology, pathology, radiology, and many other biomedical domains. Holistic image analysis comprises interdependent subtasks such as segmentation, detection, and recognition of relevant objects. Here, we propose BiomedParse, a biomedical foundation model for imaging parsing that can jointly conduct segmentation, detection, and recognition for 82 object types across 9 imaging modalities. Through joint learning, we can improve accuracy for individual tasks and enable novel applications such as segmenting all relevant objects in an image through a text prompt, rather than requiring users to laboriously specify the bounding box for each object. We leveraged readily available natural-language labels or descriptions accompanying those datasets and use GPT-4 to harmonize the noisy, unstructured text information with established biomedical object ontologies. We created a large dataset comprising over six million triples of image, segmentation mask, and textual description. On image segmentation, we showed that BiomedParse is broadly applicable, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on 102,855 test image-mask-label triples across 9 imaging modalities (everything). On object detection, which aims to locate a specific object of interest, BiomedParse again attained state-of-the-art performance, especially on objects with irregular shapes (everywhere). On object recognition, which aims to identify all objects in a given image along with their semantic types, we showed that BiomedParse can simultaneously segment and label all biomedical objects in an image (all at once). In summary, BiomedParse is an all-in-one tool for biomedical image analysis by jointly solving segmentation, detection, and recognition for all major biomedical image modalities, paving the path for efficient and accurate image-based biomedical discovery.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>We present personalized residuals and localized attention-guided sampling for efficient concept-driven generation using text-to-image diffusion models. Our method first represents concepts by freezing the weights of a pretrained text-conditioned diffusion model and learning low-rank residuals for a small subset of the model's layers. The residual-based approach then directly enables application of our proposed sampling technique, which applies the learned residuals only in areas where the concept is localized via cross-attention and applies the original diffusion weights in all other regions. Localized sampling therefore combines the learned identity of the concept with the existing generative prior of the underlying diffusion model. We show that personalized residuals effectively capture the identity of a concept in ~3 minutes on a single GPU without the use of regularization images and with fewer parameters than previous models, and localized sampling allows using the original model as strong prior for large parts of the image.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract: </strong>The image matching field has been witnessing a continuous emergence of novel learnable feature matching techniques, with ever-improving performance on conventional benchmarks. However, our investigation shows that despite these gains, their potential for real-world applications is restricted by their limited generalization capabilities to novel image domains. In this paper, we introduce OmniGlue, the first learnable image matcher that is designed with generalization as a core principle. OmniGlue leverages broad knowledge from a vision foundation model to guide the feature matching process, boosting generalization to domains not seen at training time. Additionally, we propose a novel keypoint position-guided attention mechanism which disentangles spatial and appearance information, leading to enhanced matching descriptors. We perform comprehensive experiments on a suite of $7$ datasets with varied image domains, including scene-level, object-centric and aerial images. OmniGlue's novel components lead to relative gains on unseen domains of $20.9\%$ with respect to a directly comparable reference model, while also outperforming the recent LightGlue method by $9.5\%$ relatively.Code and model can be found at this https URL</li>
